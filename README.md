# OpenShift Clients

The OpenShift client `oc` simplifies working with Kubernetes and OpenShift
clusters, offering a number of advantages over `kubectl` such as easy login,
kube config file management, and access to developer tools. The `kubectl`
binary is included alongside for when strict Kubernetes compliance is necessary.

To learn more about OpenShift, visit [docs.openshift.com](https://docs.openshift.com)
