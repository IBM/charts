## Introduction
IBM Event Endpoint Management provides the capability to describe and catalog your Kafka topics as event sources, and to share the details of the topics with application developers.

## Chart Details
Application developers can discover the event source and configure their applications to subscribe to the stream of events, providing self-service access to the message content from the event stream.
Access to event sources is managed by the Event Gateway, which handles the incoming requests from applications to consume from a topic's stream of events.

### Prerequisites
Before installing IBM Event Endpoint Management, ensure you create a secret called `ibm-entitlement-key` in the namespace where you want to create an instance of IBM Event Endpoint Management
1. Obtain an entitlement key from https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary
2. Create an image pull secret called `ibm-entitlement-key` using `cp` as the username, your entitlement key as the password, and `cp.icr.io` as the docker server:

`kubectl create secret docker-registry ibm-entitlement-key --docker-username=cp --docker-password=<your-entitlement-key> --docker-server=cp.icr.io -n <target-namespace>`

It is strongly recommended to install the IBM Certificate Manager before the installation of IBM Event Endpoint Management. This will facilitate the handling of certificates for secure communication in the product.
