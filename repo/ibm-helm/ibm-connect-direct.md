# IBM Connect Direct for Unix v6.4.0

## Introduction
  
IBM® Connect:Direct® for UNIX links technologies and moves all types of information between networked systems and computers. It manages high-performance transfers by providing such features as automation, reliability, efficient use of resources, application integration, and ease of use. Connect:Direct (C:D) for UNIX offers choices in communications protocols, hardware platforms, and operating systems. It provides the flexibility to move information among mainframe systems, midrange systems, desktop systems, LAN-based workstations and cloud based storage providers (Amazon S3 Object Store for current release). To find out more, see the Knowledge Center for [IBM Connect:Direct for UNIX](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/connect-direct/6.4.0?topic=overview-what-is-connectdirect).

## Chart Details

This chart deploys IBM Connect Direct on a container management platform with the following resources deployments

- a statefulset pod `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct` with 1 replica by default.
- a configMap `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct`. This is used to provide default configuration in cd_param_file.
- a service `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct`. This is used to expose the C:D services for accessing using clients.
- a service-account `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct-serviceaccount`. This service will not be created if `serviceAccount.create` is `false`.
- a persistence volume claim `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct`.
- a monitoring dashboard `<release-name>-ibm-connect-direct`. This will not be created if `dashboard.enabled` is `false`.

## Backup & Restore

**To Backup:**

You need to take backup of configuration data and other information like stats and TCQ which are present in the persistent volume by following the below steps:

1. Go to mount path of Persistent Volume. 

2. Make copy of all of the directories listed below and store them at your desired and secured place.
   * `WORK`
   * `CFG`
   * `SECPLUS`
   * `SECURITY`
   * `PROCESS`
   * `FACONFIG`
   * `FALOG`

> **Note**:In case of traditional installation of Connect:Direct for Unix, you should take the backup of the below directories and save them at your desired location:
   * `<installDir>/work`
   * `<installDir>/ndm/cfg`
   * `<installDir>/ndm/secure+`
   * `<installDir>/ndm/security`
   * `<installDir>/process`
   * `<installDir>/file_agent/config`
   * `<installDir>/file_agent/log`
   

**To Restore:**

Restoring the data in new deployment, it can be achieved by following steps

1. Create a Persistent Volume.

2. Copy all the backed up directories to the mount path of Persistent Volume.

3. Create a new deployment using the above Persistent Volume using variable `persistentVolume.name` in helm cli command. The pod would come up with desired data.
