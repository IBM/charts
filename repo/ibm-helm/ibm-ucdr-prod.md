# UrbanCode Deploy Agent Relay - Helm Chart

## Introduction
[UrbanCode Deploy Agent Relay](https://www.urbancode.com/product/deploy/) is a tool for automating application deployments through your environments. It is designed to facilitate rapid feedback and continuous delivery in agile development while providing the audit trails, versioning and approvals needed in production.

## Chart Details
* This chart deploys a single instance of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy agent relay that may be scaled to multiple instances.
* Includes a StatefulSet workload object

## Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes 1.16.0+; kubectl and oc CLI; Helm 3;
  * Install and setup oc/kubectl CLI depending on your architecture.
    * [ppc64le](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/ppc64le/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz)
    * [s390x](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/s390x/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz)
    * [x86_64](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/stable/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz)
  * [Install and setup the Helm 3 CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

2. Accessing the container Image - The UrbanCode Deploy agent relay image is accessed via the IBM Entitled Registry.

    * Log in to [MyIBM Container Software Library](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary) with the IBMid and password that are associated with the entitled software.
    * In the Entitlement keys section, select Copy key to copy the entitlement key to the clipboard.
    * An imagePullSecret must be created to be able to authenticate and pull images from the Entitled Registry.  Once this secret has been created you will specify the secret name as the value for the image.secret parameter in the values.yaml you provide to 'helm install ...'.  Note that secrets are namespace scoped, so they must be created in every namespace you plan to install UrbanCode Deploy agent relay into.  Following is an example command to create an imagePullSecret named 'entitledregistry-secret'.

  ```
  oc create secret docker-registry entitledregistry-secret --docker-username=cp --docker-password=<EntitlementKey> --docker-server=cp.icr.io
  ```
3. The UrbanCode agent relay must have a UrbanCode Deploy server to connect to.

4. Secret - A Kubernetes Secret object must be created to store the UrbanCode Deploy server's Codestation authentication token and the password for all keystores used by the product.  The name of the secret you create must be specified in the property 'secret.name' in your values.yaml.

* Through the oc/kubectl CLI, create a Secret object in the target namespace.  Generate the base64 encoded values for the Codestation token and password for all keystores used by the product.

```
echo -n 255b21b7-ca48-4f2e-95c0-048fdbff4197 | base64
MjU1YjIxYjctY2E0OC00ZjJlLTk1YzAtMDQ4ZmRiZmY0MTk3
echo -n 'MyKeystorePassword' | base64
TXlLZXlzdG9yZVBhc3N3b3Jk
```

  * Create a file named secret.yaml with the following contents, using your secret name and base64 encoded values.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ucdr-secrets
type: Opaque
data:
  cspassword: MjU1YjIxYjctY2E0OC00ZjJlLTk1YzAtMDQ4ZmRiZmY0MTk3
  keystorepassword: TXlLZXlzdG9yZVBhc3N3b3Jk
```

  * Create the Secret using oc apply

```
oc apply -f ./secret.yaml
```

  * Delete or shred the secret.yaml file.

5. A PersistentVolume that will hold the conf directory for the UrbanCode Deploy relay is required.  If your cluster supports dynamic volume provisioning you will not need to create a PersistentVolume (PV) or PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) before installing this chart.  If your cluster does not support dynamic volume provisioning, you will need to either ensure a PV is available or you will need to create one before installing this chart.  You can optionally create the PVC to bind it to a specific PV, or you can let the chart create a PVC and bind to any available PV that meets the required size and storage class.  Sample YAML to create the PV and PVC are provided below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ucdr-conf-vol
  labels:
    volume: ucdr-conf-vol
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    server: 192.168.1.17
    path: /volume1/k8/ucdr-conf
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ucdr-conf-volc
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Mi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      volume: ucdr-conf-vol
```
* The following storage options have been tested with IBM UrbanCode Deploy

  * IBM Block Storage supports the ReadWriteOnce access mode.  ReadWriteMany is not supported.

  * IBM File Storage supports ReadWriteMany which is required for multiple instances of the UrbanCode Deploy agent.

* IBM UrbanCode Deploy requires non-root access to persistent storage. When using IBM File Storage you need to either use the IBM provided “gid” File storage class with default group ID 65531 or create your own customized storage class to specify a different group ID. Please follow the instructions at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_troubleshoot_storage#cs_storage_nonroot for more details.

6.  If a route or ingress is used to access the WSS port of the UrbanCode Deploy server from an UrbanCode Deploy relay, then port 443 should be specified along with the configured URL to access the proper service port defined for the UrbanCode Deploy Server.


### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

If you are running on OpenShift, skip this section and continue to the [SecurityContextConstraints Requirements](#securitycontextconstraints-requirements) section below.

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you.

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy named [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart.

  * Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is based on the most restrictive policy,
        requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."

```

### SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a `SecurityContextConstraints` to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. The predefined `SecurityContextConstraints` name: [`ibm-restricted-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this `SecurityContextConstraints` resource you can proceed to install the chart.

  * Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:

```
  apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
  kind: SecurityContextConstraints
  metadata:
    annotations:
    name: ibm-ucd-prod-scc

## Resources Required
* 200MB of RAM
* 100 millicores CPU

## Installing the Chart

Add the IBM helm chart repository to the local client.
```bash
$ helm repo add ibm-helm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/ibm-helm/
```

Get a copy of the values.yaml file from the helm chart so you can update it with values used by the install.
```bash
$ helm inspect values ibm-helm/ibm-ucdr-prod > myvalues.yaml
```

Edit the file myvalues.yaml to specify the parameter values to use when installing the UCD agent relay instance.  The [configuration](#Configuration) section lists the parameter values that can be set.

To install the chart into namespace 'ucdtest' with the release name `my-ucdr-release` and use the values from myvalues.yaml:

```bash
$ helm install my-ucdr-release ibm-helm/ibm-ucdr-prod --namespace ucdtest --values myvalues.yaml
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`.

## Verifying the Chart
Check the Resources->Agent Relays page of the UrbanCode Deploy server UI to verify the agent relay has connected successfully.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-ucdr-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-ucdr-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
