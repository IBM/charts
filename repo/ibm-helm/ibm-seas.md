# IBM Sterling External Authentication Server v6.1.0.0

## Introduction

IBM Sterling External Authentication Server allows you to implement extended authentication and validation services for IBM products, called client applications. Sterling External Authentication Server includes a server that client applications connect to and a GUI to configure Sterling External Authentication Server requirements. To find out more, see the Knowledge Center for [IBM SEAS](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/external-auth-server/6.1.0).

## Chart Details

This chart deploys IBM Sterling External Authentication Server on a container management platform with the following resources deployments

- a statefulset pod `<release-name>-ibm-seas` with 1 replica.
- a configMap `<release-name>-ibm-seas`. This is used to provide default configuration in seas_config_file.
- a service `<release-name>-ibm-seas`. This is used to expose the SEAS services for accessing using clients.
- a service-account `<release-name>-ibm-seas-serviceaccount`. This service will not be created if `serviceAccount.create` is `false`.
- a persistence volume claim `<release-name>-ibm-seas`.

## Prerequisites

Please refer to [Planning](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/external-auth-server/6.1.0?topic=software-planning) and [Pre-installation tasks](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/external-auth-server/6.1.0?topic=installing-pre-installation-tasks) section in the online Knowledge Center documentation. 

### SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The IBM Sterling External Authentication Server chart requires an SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) to be tied to the target namespace prior to deployment. This chart defines a custom SCC which is the minimum set of permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart and the Sterling External Authentication Server container to function properly. It is based on the predefined restricted SCC with extra required privileges. This is the recommended SCC for this chart and it can be created on the cluster by cluster administrator. The SCC and cluster role for this chart is defined below. The cluster administrator can either use the snippets given below or the scripts provided in the Helm chart to create the SCC, cluster role and tie it to the project where deployment will be performed. In both the cases, same SCC and cluster role will be created. It is recommended to use the scripts in the Helm chart so that required SCC and cluster role is created without any issue.

  As team admin the namespace scoped pre-install script is located at:
  - chmod +x pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh
  - pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh <Namespace/Project>
  
### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

In Kubernetes the Pod Security Policy (PSP) control is implemented as optional (but recommended). [Click here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) for more information on Pod Security Policy. Based on your organization security policy, you may need to decide the pod security policy for your Kubernetes cluster. The IBM Sterling External Authentication Server chart defines a custom Pod Security Policy which is the minimum set of permissions/ capabilities needed to deploy this chart and the Sterling External Authentication Server container to function properly. This is the recommended PSP for this chart and it can be created on the cluster by cluster administrator. The PSP and cluster role for this chart is defined below. The cluster administrator can either use the snippets given below or the scripts provided in the Helm chart to create the PSP, cluster role and tie it to the namespace where deployment will be performed. In both the cases, same PSP and cluster role will be created. It is recommended to use the scripts in the Helm chart so that required PSP and cluster role is created without any issue.

## Backup & Restore

**To Backup:**

You need to take backup of configuration data which are present in the persistent volume by following the below steps:

1. Go to mount path of Persistent Volume.

2. Make copy of all of the directories listed below and store them at your desired and secured place.
   * `SEAS`
  
> **Note**:In case of traditional installation of SEAS, you should take the backup of the installation directory and save them at your desired location:
   * `SEAS`

**To Restore:**

Restoring the data in new deployment, it can be achieved by following steps

1. Create a Persistent Volume.

2. Copy all the backed up directories to the mount path of Persistent Volume.

3. Create a new deployment using the helm CLI command. The pod would come up with desired data.

- IBM Sterling External Authentication Server chart supports only amd64 architecture.
- Non-persistence mode is not supported.
- The rollback support is not available from 6.1.0.0 to 6.0.3.0 due to some structural changes in IBM Sterling External Authentication Server.
