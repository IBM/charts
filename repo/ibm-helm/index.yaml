    description: Data transformation is a required function for most B2B and A2A integration
      patterns, and is critical in many industries such as Healthcare claims processing
      and Financial Services payments adjudication.  Individual transactions are received
      from a trading partner in a bulk file.  These transactions need to separated,
      validated (to ensure you have the correct information form the trading partner),
