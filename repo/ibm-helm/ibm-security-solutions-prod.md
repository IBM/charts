## Introduction
IBM Cloud Pak&reg; for Security Shared Platform Services, `ibm-security-solutions-prod`, provides a shared platform that integrates your disconnected security systems for a complete view of all your security data, without moving the data. It turns individual apps, services, and capabilities into unified solutions to empower your teams to act faster, and improves your security posture with collective intelligence from a global community. Reduce complexity, expand your visibility and maximize your existing investments with a powerful, open, cloud security platform that connects your teams, tools and data. For further details see the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTDPP_1.7.0/docs/scp-core/overview.html).

## Chart Details

This chart installs `ibm-security-solutions-prod`, providing the IBM Cloud Pak for Security Shared Core Services.

The Cases and Postgres operators deployed as part of this chart are Namespace-scoped. They watch and manage resources within the namespace that IBM Cloud Pak for Security is installed

## Prerequisites

Please refer to the `Preparing to install IBM Cloud PakÂ® for Security` section in the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTDPP_1.7.0/docs/security-pak/install_prep.html).

## PodDisruptionBudget
Pod disruption budget is used to maintain high availability during Node maintenance. Administrator role or higher is required to enable pod disruption budget on clusters with role based access control. The default is false. See `global.poddisruptionbudget` in the [configuration](#configuration) section.


## Custom SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints object to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation.

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-privileged-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, It is required that you allow the pods running Elasticsearch to run privileged containers. The reason for this requirement is to meet the production settings stated officially by the Elasticsearch documentation. To achieve this, you must you must also create a service account called ibm-dba-ek-isc-cases-elastic-bai-psp-sa that has the ibm-privileged-scc SecurityContextConstraint to allow running privileged containers.

## Resources Required

By default, `ibm-security-solutions-prod` has the following resource requests requirements per pod:

| Service  | Memory (GB) | CPU (cores)
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Cases  |    9950Mi   |  1760M  |
| Platform | 2190Mi | 1225M  |
| DE | 1024Mi | 300M |
| CAR | 128Mi | 100M |
| Extensions | 128Mi | 100M |
| UDS | 250Mi | 50M |
| TII | 900Mi | 600M |
| TIS | 1536Mi | 600M |
| CSA Adapter| 256Mi | 200M |
| Backup and Restore | 128Mi | 50M |
| Risk Manager | 2212Mi | 750M |
| Threat Investigator | 843Mi | 260M |

## Storage
IBM Cloud Pak for Security requires specific persistent volumes and persistent volume claims. To provide the required storage, persistent volume claims are created automatically during the installation of IBM Cloud Pak for Security.

Persistent storage separates the management of storage from the management and lifecycle of compute. For example, persistent storage, allows data to persist across Kubernetes container and worker restarts.

For more details on the size of the persistent volume please refer to [persistent storage requirements](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTDPP_1.7.0/docs/scp-core/persistent_storage.html)

The persistent volume claim must have an access mode of ReadWriteOnce (RWO).

For volumes that support ownership management, specify the group ID of the group owning the persistent volumes' file systems using the `storageClassFsGroup` and `storageClassSupplementalGroups` parameters as described in [configuration](#configuration) below.


## Installing the Chart

Please refer to the `Installation` section in the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTDPP_1.7.0/docs/security-pak/installation.html).

### Verifying the Chart
