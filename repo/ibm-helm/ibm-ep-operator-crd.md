## Introduction
IBM Event Processing incorporates Apache Flink to transform event streaming data in real time, helping you turn events into insights. You can take existing events and combine them through flows where you define the processing to be completed on the events. You connect to event sources to bring event data (messages) from Apache Kafka topics into your flow, and then set processing actions you want to take on your events.
