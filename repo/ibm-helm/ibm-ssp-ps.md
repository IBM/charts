# IBM Sterling Secure Proxy Perimeter Server v6.1.0.0

## Introduction
  
A perimeter server is used by Sterling Secure Proxy to manage inbound and outbound TCP communication. This software tool enables you to manage the communications flow between outer layers of your network and the TCP-based transport adapters. Perimeter servers can be used to restrict areas where TCP connections are initiated from more secure areas to less secure areas. To find out more, see the Knowledge Center for [IBM Sterling Secure Proxy Perimeter Server](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/secure-proxy/6.1.0).


## Chart Details

This chart deploys IBM Sterling Secure Proxy Perimeter Server on a container management platform with the following resources deployments

- a statefulset pod `<release-name>-ibm-ssp-ps` with 1 replica by default.
- a configMap `<release-name>-ibm-ssp-ps`. This is used to provide default configuration in ps_config_file.
- a service `<release-name>-ibm-ssp-ps`. This is used to expose the PS services for accessing using clients.
- a service-account `<release-name>-ibm-ssp-ps-serviceaccount`. This service will not be created if `serviceAccount.create` is `false`.


## Prerequisites

Please refer to [Planning](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/secure-proxy/6.1.0?topic=software-planning) and [Pre-installation tasks](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/secure-proxy/6.1.0?topic=installing-pre-installation-tasks) section in the online Knowledge Center documentation. 

### SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

The IBM Sterling Secure Proxy PS chart requires an SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) to be tied to the target namespace prior to deployment. This chart defines a custom SCC which is the minimum set of permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart and the Sterling Secure Proxy PS container to function properly. It is based on the predefined restricted SCC with extra required privileges. This is the recommended SCC for this chart and it can be created on the cluster by cluster administrator. The SCC and cluster role for this chart is defined below. The cluster administrator can either use the snippets given below or the scripts provided in the Helm chart to create the SCC, cluster role and tie it to the project where deployment will be performed. In both the cases, same SCC and cluster role will be created. It is recommended to use the scripts in the Helm chart so that required SCC and cluster role is created without any issue.

  As a cluster admin the pre-install script is located at:
  - chmod +x pre-install/clusterAdministration/createSecurityClusterPrereqs.sh

  As team admin the namespace scoped pre-install script is located at:
  - chmod +x pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh
  - pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh <Namespace/Project>
  
### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

In Kubernetes the Pod Security Policy (PSP) control is implemented as optional (but recommended). [Click here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) for more information on Pod Security Policy. Based on your organization security policy, you may need to decide the pod security policy for your Kubernetes cluster. The IBM Sterling Secure Proxy PS chart defines a custom Pod Security Policy which is the minimum set of permissions/ capabilities needed to deploy this chart and the Sterling Secure Proxy PS container to function properly. This is the recommended PSP for this chart and it can be created on the cluster by cluster administrator. The PSP and cluster role for this chart is defined below. The cluster administrator can either use the snippets given below or the scripts provided in the Helm chart to create the PSP, cluster role and tie it to the namespace where deployment will be performed. In both the cases, same PSP and cluster role will be created. It is recommended to use the scripts in the Helm chart so that required PSP and cluster role is created without any issue.
