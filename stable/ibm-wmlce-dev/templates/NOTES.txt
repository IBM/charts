Getting Started with MLDL Frameworks

    The WMLCE packages are installed into a conda environment so after installation is complete, the frameworks are ready for use. Each framework provides a test script to verify some of its functions. These test scripts include tests and examples that are sourced from the various communities. 

    To run the test script for a particular framework, run:

    $ <framework>-test
