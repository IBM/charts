 # Erasure coding allows you to keep your data safe while reducing the storage overhead. Instead of
 # creating multiple replicas of the data, erasure coding divides the original data into chunks of equal
 # size, then generates extra chunks of that same size for redundancy.
 # Note: High performance applications typically will not use erasure coding due to the performance
 # overhead of creating and distributing the chunks in the cluster.
