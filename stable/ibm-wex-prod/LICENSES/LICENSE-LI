Third Party Data and Services

The Program may contain links to or be used to access third party data services, databases, web services, software, or other third party content (all, "content"). Access to this content is provided "AS-IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Access can be terminated by the relevant third parties at their sole discretion at any time. Licensee may be required to enter into separate agreements with the third parties for the access to or use of such content. IBM is not a party to any such separate agreements and as an express condition of this license Licensee agrees to comply with the terms of such separate agreements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Application Instance

Application Instance is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An entitlement is required for each instance of an application connected to or managed by the Program. An application in a test, development, staging, or production environment is each considered to be a separate instance of the application and each must have an entitlement. As well, multiple application instances in a single environment are each considered to be separate instances of the application and each must have an entitlement.

Resource Value Unit (RVU)

Resource Value Unit (RVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. RVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number of units of a specific resource used or managed by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment for the specific resources as specified in the table below. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

For each physical Server, Licensee must have sufficient entitlements for the lesser of 1) the sum of all available Virtual Processor Cores on all Virtual Servers or 2) all available Processor Cores on the physical Server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

The Resources for the purpose of RVU calculation are Terabytes of content analyzed by the Program. A Terabyte is 2 to the 40th power bytes. Content analyzed by the Program may fall into one of two categories, Analytics Collections, or non-Analytics Collections.

Analytics Collections refer to collections created in the Watson Explorer Annotation Administration Console, or created in the Watson Explorer Content Analytics Administration Console or via the API as type "Content Analytics" or "Analytics", or created in the oneWEX Administration Console. Analytics Collections are calculated based on 1/10 of a Terabyte per Resource. 

Non-Analytics Collections, which include all other content analyzed by the Program, are calculated based on one Terabyte per Resource. 

Resource Value Unit Conversion Table
From 1 to 5 Resources, 1.00 RVU per Resource
From 6 to 25 Resources, 5 RVUs plus 0.45 RVUs per Resource above 5 
From 26 to 50 Resources, 14 RVUs plus 0.35 RVUs per Resource above 25 
From 51 to 100 Resources, 22.75 RVUs plus 0.08 RVUs per Resource above 50
From 101 to 500 Resources, 26.75 RVUs plus 0.04 RVUs per Resource above 100 
For more than 500 Resources, 42.75 RVUs plus 0.02 RVUs per Resource above 500 


Components Not Used for Establishing Required Entitlements

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program components are not taken into consideration. In other words, Licensee may install and use the following Program components, under the license terms, but these components are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.
