# WebSphere Liberty Helm Chart

## Introduction 

WebSphere Liberty is a fast, dynamic, and easy-to-use Java EE application server. Ideal for developers, but also ready for production, Liberty is a combination of IBM technology and open source software, with fast startup times (<2 seconds), and a simple XML configuration. All in a package that's <70 MB to download. You can be developing applications in no time. With a flexible, modular runtime, you can download additional features from the Liberty Repository or strip it back to the essentials for deployment into production environments. Everything in Liberty is designed to help you get your job done how you want to do it.

## Resources Required

A persistent volume is required, if you plan on using the transaction service within Liberty. The `server.xml` Liberty configuration file must be configured to place the transaction log on this volume so that it persists, if the server fails and restarts.


## Accessing WebSphere Liberty

From a browser, use http://*external-ip*:*nodeport* to access the application.

## Chart Details

### Prerequisites

#### Security Policies

The WebSphere Liberty container runs as root and has been tested with a security policy that allowed the following capabilities:
chown, dac_override,fowner, fsetid, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net_bind_service, net_raw, sys_chroot, mknod, audit_write, setfcap+eip

We are targeting to reduce the list above in future releases of this helm chart.  

Please see the following documentation pages for more information on how to set these policies:
-    https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/
-    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/

### Limitations

See RELEASENOTES.md

### Installing the Chart

The Helm chart has the following values that can be overridden by using `--set name=value`. For example:

*    `helm repo add ibm-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable/`
*    `helm install --name liberty2 --set resources.constraints.enabled=true --set autoscaling.enabled=true --set autoscaling.minReplicas=2 ibm-charts/ibm-websphere-liberty --debug`

### Configuration

### Configuring Liberty

#### Liberty Docker image requirements

The Helm chart requires the Docker image to have certain directories linked. The `websphere-liberty` image from Docker Hub will already have the expected links. If you are not using this image, you must add the following to your Dockerfile:
```shell
ENV LOG_DIR /logs
ENV WLP_OUTPUT_DIR /opt/ibm/wlp/output
RUN mkdir /logs \
    && ln -s $WLP_OUTPUT_DIR/defaultServer /output \
    && ln -s /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer /config
```

#### ConfigMap

The Helm release ConfigMap contains Liberty server configuration that is driven by the configuration choices of the chart deployer, using associated environmental variables. The Liberty container receives automatic updates to files from this ConfigMap.


#### Applying a production license

##### 18.0.0.3+

If your application container is using WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.3 binary and newer version you no longer have to apply a production license - you only need to have entitlement to use WebSphere Liberty in production (either via ICP or other sales channels).

##### 18.0.0.2-

For WebSphere Liberty 18.0.0.2 binaries and older versions, please see the steps below to obtain production support:

To apply a license when building the Liberty Docker image
1. Copy the [base|core|nd] license jar to the directory the Dockerfile resides
2. Add the following to the Dockerfile
```shell
COPY wlp-nd-license.jar /tmp/wlp-nd-license.jar
RUN java -jar /tmp/wlp-nd-license.jar --acceptLicense /opt/ibm/wlp \
    && rm /tmp/wlp-nd-license.jar
```
3. Set the `image.license` value to `accept` to indicate the license has been accepted
  - `helm install --tls --set image.license="accept" ibm-charts/ibm-websphere-liberty`
    
Alternatively, to apply the license at deployment time

1. Create a Kubernetes secret in the namespace of the Liberty deployment
  - The secret name and jar file name must be of the the naming convention wlp-[base|core|nd]-license
  - `kubectl create secret generic wlp-nd-license --from-file=wlp-nd-license.jar`
2. Set the `image.license` value to one of [base|core|nd]
  - `helm install --tls --set image.license="nd" ibm-charts/ibm-websphere-liberty`


#### Transaction logs

If the server fails and restarts, then to persist the transaction logs (preserve them through server restarts) you must set logs.persistTransactionLogs to true and configure persistence in the helm chart. You must also add the following to your server.xml in your docker image.

```xml
<transaction
    recoverOnStartup="true"
    waitForRecovery="true" />
```

For more information about the transaction element and its attributes, see [transaction - Transaction Manager](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.liberty.autogen.nd.doc/ae/rwlp_config_transaction.html) in the Liberty documentation.


#### Persisting logs

Create a persistent volume (PV) in a shared storage, NFS for example, with the following specification:
```yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: <persistent volume name>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: <optional - must match PVC>
  nfs:
    server: <NFS Server IP>
    path: <NFS PATH>
```
Note: For NFS PATH you need to create your directory manually before deploying the persistent volume.

You can create a PV using the above template by executing:
```shell
kubectl create -f <yaml-file>
```
You can also create a PV from IBM Cloud Private dashboard by following these steps:

1.  From the dashboard panel, click Create resource.
2.  Copy and paste the PV template.
3.  Click Create.

#### Analyzing Liberty messages

Logging in JSON format is enabled by default. Log events are forwarded to Elasticsearch automatically. In 18.0.0.3+, audit events can also be forwarded to Elasticsearch. Audit events may contain sensitive data. Make sure you have enabled security in the logging stack if you are deploying your chart into IBM Cloud Private.

Use Kibana to monitor and analyze the log events. Sample Kibana dashboards are provided in the Helm chart's [dashboards](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/stable/ibm-websphere-liberty/ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/dashboards) directory.

For more information, see [Analyzing Liberty messages in IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_icp_json_logging.html) in the Knowledge Center.


#### SSL Configuration

SSL is enabled by default. The chart automatically adds the `ssl-1.0` feature to your application server. When SSL is enabled, only secure ports are exposed. These ports are `9443` (HTTPS), `9402` (IIOPS), and `7286` (JMS). Only the ports you enable are exposed. When SSL is enabled, the application must be accessed accordingly, e.g. `https://`.

Note that due to requirements of the IIOP protocol, when you enable both IIOP and SSL, a secure and non-secure IIOP are configured, with the default port values of `9402` (secure) and `2809` (non-secure).

It is highly recommended to set `createClusterSSLConfiguration` and `useClusterSSLConfiguration` to true to establish trust between applications.

To turn off SSL:

1. Set `ssl.enabled` to `false`.
2. Depending on which ports you enable, change `port` and `targetPorts` to non-secure ports. By convention, the default port numbers for non-secure mode are `9080` (HTTPS), `2809` (IIOP), and `7276` (JMS).

#### Ingress configuration

If you are deploying your chart into IBM Cloud Private:

* `ingress.host` can be provided and set to a fully-qualified domain name that resolves to the IP address of your cluster’s proxy node. For example `example.com` resolved to the proxy node. When a domain name is not available, the service [`nip.io`](http://nip.io) can be used to provide a resolution based on an IP address. For example, `liberty.<IP>.nip.io` where `<IP>` would be replaced with the IP address of your cluster’s proxy node. The IP address of your cluster’s proxy node can be found by using the following command: `kubectl get nodes -l proxy=true`. Users can also leave this parameter as empty.

* `ingress.secretName` set to the name of the secret containing Ingress TLS certificate and key. If this is not provided, it dynamically creates a self-signed certificate/key, stores it in a Kubernetes secret and uses the secret in Ingress' TLS.

If the chart is deployed into IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service:

* `ingress.host` must be provided and set to the IBM-provided Ingress _subdomain_ or your custom domain. See [Select an app domain and TLS termination](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_ingress.html#public_inside_2) for more info on how to get this value in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.
* `ingress.secretName` must be provided. If you are using the IBM-provided Ingress domain, set this parameter to the name of the IBM-provided Ingress secret. However, if you are using a custom domain, set this parameter to the secret that you created earlier that holds your custom TLS certificate and key. See [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_ingress.html#public_inside_2) for more info on how to get these value in an IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service cluster.

#### Session Caching

When installing the default Hazelcast Docker image, ensure that an image policy exists that allows pulling from the registry `docker.io/hazelcast/hazelcast:*`.

Session caching is disabled by default. To use session caching, the Liberty feature sessionCache-1.0 must be installed. Add the following to the websphere-liberty Dockerfile to install the sessionCache-1.0 feature, if it is not already present:
```
#For minified websphere-liberty Docker images, add this line to the websphere-liberty Dockerfile. Tolerate rc 22, feature is already installed.
RUN installUtility install --acceptLicense sessionCache-1.0 || if [ $? -ne 22 ]; then exit $?; fi
```
The session caching feature builds on top of an existing technology called JCache (JSR 107), which provides an API for distributed in-memory caching.  There are several providers of JCache implementations.  One example is Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid. Enabling Hazelcast session caching automatically retrieves the Hazelcast client libraries from the hazelcast-kubernetes image, and configures the Hazelcast client and Liberty server feature sessionCache-1.0. The configuration is held in the ConfigMap associated with the helm release. By default, the Hazelcast client will auto-discover the Hazelcast server cluster within the same namespace.

#### Monitoring

Monitoring is disabled by default. To use monitoring, the HTTP service must be enabled. When Monitoring is enabled, Liberty features `mpMetrics-1.1` and `monitor-1.0` will be used to monitor the server runtime and application metrics. 

Metrics endpoint `/metrics` is configured without authentication using HTTP port. When SSL is enabled, an additional service (ClusterIP type) is created using port 9080 to provide metrics data to prometheus. This also means the applications and other endpoints can also be accessed within the cluster on port 9080. When SSL is not enabled, the user-specified port of the HTTP service is used. If the service is exposed outside of the cluster then the unauthenticated metrics endpoint `/metrics` will be exposed as well.

Metrics are collected by Prometheus automatically. Use Grafana to monitor and analyze the metrics.

#### Resource Reference

The helm chart creates the following Kubernetes resources that drive the configuration of the Liberty container. The configuration is used to ensure consistency of protocol, port and security configuration between the helm deployed Kubernetes objects and Liberty.
