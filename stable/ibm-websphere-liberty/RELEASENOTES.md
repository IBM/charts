# Whatâ€™s new...

## Latest: Chart Version 1.10.0

1. WebSphere Liberty Docker images based on Universal Base Images (UBI) are now publicly available from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/websphere-liberty) and the chart uses it as the default image
1. Integration with Application Navigator
1. Defined the most restrictive SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) for OpenShift support
1. A self-signed certificate for ingress is no longer generated. User should provide their own certificate using `ingress.secretName`. Otherwise, the default certificate of the ingress controller is used
1. Added support for image pull secret, via `image.pullSecret` parameter, to access private image registry.
1. Updated Grafana and Kibana dashboards
1. Updated `kubeVersion` of chart to `>=1.9.0-any` to support various cloud environments. Ensure patch for [CVE-2018-1002105](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/71411) is installed in your Kubernetes environment
1. Updated default resource limit values for CPU and memory

## Known Issues

1. Upgrade from all versions except v1.0.0 is supported.
1. Rollback from v1.5.0 to v1.4.0 is not supported.
1. The ability to set the reuse flag while upgrading may not work between all versions. However, it can be used when upgrading from v1.9.0 to v1.10.0.
1. If your application uses IIOP, you must remove the iiopEndpoint configuration from your server.xml before building the Docker image you intend to deploy via this Helm chart. Failure to do so will prevent port values you specify through this Helm chart from overriding those specified in your server.xml.
1. If your deployment enables IIOP and/or JMS endpoints, they will be erroneously displayed in the Launch button dropdown on the Helm Releases page of the ICP console. The Launch button only works with HTTP/S endpoints, so launching IIOP or JMS endpoints obviously will result in errors.
1. If you enable ingress during deployment _and_ specify a host value, the Launch button will return error 404.
1. If deploying to the IBM Kubernetes Service on the IBM Public Cloud, you can only create one ingress resource per host.
1. The createClusterSSLConfiguration option is not supported on z/Linux. To use the useClusterSSLConfiguration option for a deployment targeting z/Linux, you must first do a deployment on a non-z/Linux node in the same cluster, specifying the createClusterSSLConfiguration option in order to establish the cluster-scope SSL configuration.
1. The createClusterSSLConfiguration option is not supported when using [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) PodSecurityPolicy or the custom one defined in the README.md file. To use the useClusterSSLConfiguration option for a deployment, you must first create a deployment using [`ibm-anyuid-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) PodSecurityPolicy in the same cluster, specifying the createClusterSSLConfiguration option in order to establish the cluster-scope SSL configuration.
1. When upgrading the helm chart release on ICP 3.1.x with Helm CLI v2.9.1, the following [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4337) may be encountered. Workaround is to specify at least one key-value pair using `--set` as part of the `helm upgrade` command.
1. If `rbac.install` is set to `true` while upgrading to v1.9.0 or later, it may fail due to an issue related to rolebinding. The release's rolebinding must be deleted prior to upgrade. Run following commands after replacing NAMESPACE and RELEASE-NAME with your values:
    ```
    helm delete -n NAMESPACE rolebinding RELEASE-NAME-ibm-websphere-liberty
    helm upgrade --tls --reuse-values RELEASE-NAME ibm-charts/ibm-websphere-liberty
    ```
1. Istio sidecar injection is not supported in namespaces associated with [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp#podsecuritypolicy-reference), [`ibm-restricted-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc#securitycontextconstraint-reference) or the custom ones defined in the README file. To get around this problem, you would need to associate your namespace with [`ibm-privileged-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp#podsecuritypolicy-reference) or [`ibm-privileged-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc#securitycontextconstraint-reference). This because, sidecar pods must have the `NET_ADMIN` capability allowed.
1. When upgrading to ICP 3.2.0 or deploying Helm charts into ICP 3.2.0, Ingress might fail if `ingress.rewriteTarget` does not follow [the new `rewrite-target` annotation guideline](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/examples/rewrite/#rewrite-target). For more information on this, see [Ingress Configuration](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.docker/docs).

## Limitations

The chart does not yet provide an out of the box secure configuration for the `/metrics` endpoint.  The `/metrics` endpoint is served only via HTTP without authentication since prometheus in IBM Cloud Private is not able to scrape secured endpoints at this time.
