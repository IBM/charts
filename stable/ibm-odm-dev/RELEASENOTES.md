# Breaking Changes
* None

# Upgrading
When you upgrade the ibm-odm-dev chart from one version to another, if you want to keep your existing data, you must uncheck the "Populate sample data" option.
Otherwise, the database is recreated with the original sample data and you lose the data generated with the previous version of the chart (reports on the sample project, new decision services...).
