# What's new in Helm chart 22.1.0
The version 22.1.0 of the Helm chart installs version 8.11.0.1 of IBM Operational Decision Manager. For a complete list of new features in this release, go to [What's new](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/odm/8.11.0?topic=notes-whats-new)

# Prerequisites
1. Kubernetes 1.19 or higher, with Helm 3.2 or higher.
2. For the internal database, create a persistent volume or use dynamic provisioning.

# Breaking Changes
* None

# Upgrading
- When you upgrade the ibm-odm-dev chart from one version to another, if you want to keep your existing data, you must uncheck the "Populate sample data" option.

  Otherwise, the database is recreated with the original sample data and you lose the data generated with the previous version of the chart (reports on the sample project, new decision services...).

- Default users password
  You must now define a password to be used by the default user **odmAdmin**. Set the parameter `usersPassword` in your `helm install` command.
