Important Notice
READ CAREFULLY: This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") for NVIDIA cuDNN,
including computer software and associated documentation ("Software"), is the
Agreement which governs use of the SOFTWARE of NVIDIA Corporation and its
subsidiaries ("NVIDIA") downloadable herefrom. By downloading, installing, copying, or

Recitals
Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or
application processor ("NVIDIA Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is
protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other
intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only
licensed for Your use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA
Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this Agreement does not
cover the sale or use of such hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a
package with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of
the SOFTWARE only.
1. Definitions
1.1. Licensee
"You", "Your" or "Licensee" shall mean the entity or individual that downloads and
uses the SOFTWARE.
1.2. Software
"SOFTWARE" shall mean the deliverables provided pursuant to this Agreement.
SOFTWARE may be provided in either source or binary form, at NVIDIA's discretion.
2. Grant of License
2.1. Rights and Limitations of Grant
Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby
grants Licensee the following limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, nonsublicensable
right to use the SOFTWARE -- and, if the SOFTWARE is provided in

SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international treaty provisions.
Accordingly, Licensee is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this Agreement and that it may
make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.

suggestions, comments or other feedback, whether verbally or in written or source
code form, relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee's products; (iii) Licensee's use
of the SOFTWARE; or (iv) optimization/interoperability of Licensee's product with the

("Residuals"), contained in the (i) Feedback provided by Licensee to NVIDIA; (ii)
Licensee's products shared or disclosed to NVIDIA in connection with the Feedback; or
(c) Licensee's confidential information voluntarily provided to NVIDIA in connection
with the Feedback, which are retained in the memories of NVIDIA's employees,

and conditions of this Agreement, NVIDIA's employees, agents, or contractors shall not
be prevented from using Residuals as part of such employee's, agent's or contractor's
general knowledge, skills, experience, talent, and/or expertise. NVIDIA shall not have
any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such employees, agents or
contractors or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of Residuals.
7.1.3. Disclaimer of Warranty
FEEDBACK FROM EITHER PARTY IS PROVIDED FOR THE OTHER PARTY'S USE "AS IS" AND
BOTH PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED AND STATUTORY
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE FEEDBACK WILL MEET THE OTHER PARTY'S
REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEEDBACK

INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7.2. Freedom of Action
Licensee agrees that this Agreement is nonexclusive and NVIDIA may currently or in
the future be developing software, other technology or confidential information
internally, or receiving confidential information from other parties that maybe similar
to the Feedback and Licensee's confidential information (as provided in Section 7.1.2

acquire, market products, or have products developed, designed, manufactured,
acquired, or marketed for NVIDIA, that compete with the Licensee's products or
confidential information.
7.3. No Implied Licenses
Under no circumstances should anything in this Agreement be construed as NVIDIA
granting by implication, estoppel or otherwise, (i) a license to any NVIDIA product or
technology other than the SOFTWARE; or (ii) any additional license rights for the
SOFTWARE other than the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement.
7.4. Miscellaneous

under, the law, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to
be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law. This Agreement is the final,
complete and exclusive agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements
relating to such subject matter, whether oral or written. This Agreement may only be
modified in writing signed by an authorized officer of NVIDIA. Licensee agrees that it
