Release: {{ .Release.Name }}
This Reactive Platform Lagom Sample was created with Lightbend's Chirper sample application.

To test this release, use the helm test command: helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --cleanup

Wait until all pods are ready

To check you can run the following commands:

kubectl rollout status deployment/chirp-deploy-{{ .Release.Name }}
kubectl rollout status deployment/friend-deploy-{{ .Release.Name }}

This will return:

deployment "chirp-deploy-{{ .Release.Name }}" successfully rolled out
deployment "friend-deploy-{{ .Release.Name }}" successfully rolled out

once the deployments have completed.

You can then access the Chirper application from your web browser via the hostname you specified (eg https://{{ .Values.hostname }})
