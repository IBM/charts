The Streams add-on is ready. Before you can provision instances of the add-on, run the following command and verify all pods are ready (1/1) 
and the status of each pod is 'Running'. NOTE: This command uses -w to watch for changes. Use ctrl-c to stop watching. 
  kubectl get pod -l streams-addon={{ .Release.Name }} -w

You can now provision instances of the add-on using the IBM Cloud Pak for Data console.
