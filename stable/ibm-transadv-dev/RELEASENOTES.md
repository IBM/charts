# Whatâ€™s new in Chart Version 1.9.4
### Analysis Enhancements
 - Analysis now displays relationships between Applications and Shared Libraries/MQ QueueManagers even if these targets have not been scanned

### Data Collector Enhancements
 - Support for collection of Apache Tomcat installations and applications
 - Support for collection on AIX systems without the need for bash to be installed
 - Enhanced support for WAS ND configurations:
   - Notification when shared libraries are referenced by applications but do not exist on the machine being scanned
   - Notification when a managed node is being scanned to ensure that it is the most appropriate location for the scan
 - Prompting for username/password if these are not provided (no need to specify them on the command line)
 - Support for the --exclude-files parameter to exclude irrelevant large files that are impacting performance
 - Support for the --verbose parameter to help trouble shoot any scanning issues
 - Defaulting to the Java that traditional WebSphere uses when it is appropriate to do so
 - Data Collector now uses the binaryScanner v19.0.0.2

### Migration Enhancements
 - Liberty Helm charts are now configured automatically to use Ingress in ICP when the original application has only a single context route
 - Instructions are provided for migrating to traditional WebSphere base running on containers

### Configuration Enhancements
 - Transformation Advisor now supports the definition of a public facing proxy with private masters and nodes in ICP
