[IBMÂ® DataPower Gateway](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/datapower-gateway) is a purpose-built security and integration gateway that addresses the business needs for mobile, API, web, SOA, B2B, and cloud workloads. It is designed to provide a consistent configuration-based approach to security, governance, integration and routing.

[//]: # (Chart Name Start)
## Chart Name
IBM DataPower Gateway Virtual Edition for Developers

[//]: # (Chart Name End)

## Introduction
This chart deploys a single IBM DataPower Gateway node with a default pattern into a Kubernetes environment. The default pattern,  the `restProxy` pattern, configures the DataPower node to act as a reverse proxy, directing client requests to the appropriate backend server.

## Chart Details
Deploys IBM DataPower Gateway Virtual Edition for Developers.
Only works with DataPower version 2018.4.1.3 and above.

## Prerequisites
WARNING! Not providing an adminUserSecret will result in a default, hardcoded admin password. \
A user with the Operator role is required to install this chart. \
helm and kubectl must be installed and configured on your system.

### Admin Password Secret
It is possible to change the default admin password prior to deployment by creating a password secret and passing that into the `adminUserSecret` value.

In order to replace the default admin credentials, the new credentials should be configured via Secret and `.Values.datapower.adminUserSecret` must be set to the name of the Secret containing the admin user's credentials.

The following are properties which can be used to define the admin user's credentials:
- `password-hashed`: The hashed value (see Linux `man 3 crypt` for format) of the admin user's password. Required if `password` is not defined.
- `password`: The admin user's password. Required if `password-hashed` is not defined; ignored if `password-hashed` is defined.
- `salt`: The salt value used when hashing `password` (see `man 3 crypt`). Optional; ignored when `password-hashed` is defined. (Default: 12345678)
- `method`: The name of the hashing algorithm used to hash `password`. Valid options: md5, sha256. Optional; ignored when `password-hashed` is defined. (Default: md5)

The following examples create Secrets with different values, but result in an admin user with the same credentials (and the same password hash):
-  `kubectl create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password=helloworld --from-literal=salt=12345678 --from-literal=method=md5`
-  `kubectl create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password=helloworld`
-  `kubectl create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password-hashed='$1$12345678$8.nskQfP4gQ8tk5xw6Wa8/'`

These two examples also result in Secrets with different values but identical admin credentials
-  `kubectl create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password=hunter2 --from-literal=salt=NaCl --from-literal=method=sha256`  
-  `kubectl create secret generic admin-credentials --from-literal=password-hashed='$5$NaCl$aOrRVimQNvZ2ZLjnAyMvT3WgaUEXoWgwkgyBrhwIg04'`
  Notice that, when setting `password-hashed`, the value must be surrounded by single-quotes

In all of the examples above, `.Values.datapower.adminUserSecret` should be set to 'admin-credentials' for the admin user to be configured.

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you:

* Predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: [`ibm-anyuid-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp)

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: ibm-anyuid-psp has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom PodSecurityPolicy using the ICP user interface or the supplied instructions/scripts in the pak_extension pre-install directory.

- From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom PodSecurityPolicy

  - Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy allows pods to run with 
          any UID and GID, but preventing access to the host."
      name: ibm-datapower-psp

## Installing the Chart
Users installing this chart must have at least "edit" permissions for the target namespace.

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` and default pattern (See .Values.patternName below):
 ```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f <myvalues.yaml> stable/ibm-datapower-dev --tls
```

Where `<myvalues.yaml>` is a yaml file that contains all values you want to override.

To deploy with HTTPS you must define `crypto.frontsideSecret`, which is the name of the Kubernetes secret containing data key.pem and cert.pem. These files are in the standard key and cert format. Create this secret prior to deploying. Create secret using `kubectl create secret generic <mycryptosecret> --from-file=key.pem --from-file=cert.pem`. Without `crypto.frontsideSecret` defined, the gateway will use HTTP.

### Verifying the Chart
See NOTES.txt associated with this chart for verification instructions

### Uninstalling the Chart
To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
```bash
$ helm delete my-release --tls
```  

To completely uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
```bash
$ helm delete --purge my-release --tls
```

## Configuration
The helm chart has the following Values that can be overriden using the install `--set` parameter or by providing your own values file. For example:

`helm install --set image.repository=<myimage> stable/ibm-datapower-dev --tls`

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/ibm-datapower-dev --tls
```

The `patternName` specifies the configuration included with the deployment. Pattern-specific options are prefixed by the `patternName` in values.yaml.
The available patterns are:

- `restProxy` : Configures the DataPower Gateway as a proxy for RESTful services, the service is available over HTTP or HTTPS(if crypto parameters are set) at `restProxy.containerPort` and proxies to `restProxy.backendURL`.
- `none` : Does not include any configuration. You may only interact with the gateway using `kubectl attach`.
> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list --tls`
