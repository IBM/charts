# Breaking Changes (Prior to 2.2.0)

* This chart has changed the way we specify images. In versions 1.0.0 through to 2.0.0 we used a common tag across all images. In this release (2.1.0) we have moved to including the tag with the name of the image. If you have customised the image name you will need to make sure that when upgrading you include the image tag on the appropriate image value.
* The parameter "File system group" (fsGroupGid) has been moved under the "Security" category (security.fsGroupGid) in this release (2.1.0). When upgrading from previous versions, if values for paramters are copied, this parameter will need to be manually updated to match your existing deployment.
