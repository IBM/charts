**Important:**
* Only one dashboard can be installed per namespace.
* If using a private Docker registry an image pull secret needs to be created before installing the chart.

## Introduction

IBMÂ® App Connect Enterprise is a market-leading lightweight enterprise integration engine that offers a fast, simple way for systems and applications to communicate with each other. As a result, it can help you achieve business value, reduce IT complexity and save money. IBM App Connect Enterprise supports a range of integration choices, skills and interfaces to optimize the value of existing technology investments.

## Chart Details

This chart deploys a single IBM App Connect Enterprise (Developer Edition) dashboard into a Kubernetes environment. The dashboard provides a UI to manage and create new integration servers and upload BAR files.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.11.0 or later, with beta APIs enabled.
* A user with cluster administrator role is required to install the chart.
* If persistence is enabled (see [configuration](#configuration)):
  * You must either create a persistent volume, or specify a storage class if classes are defined in your cluster.
  * The storage class must support read-write-many



## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation.  Choose either the predefined [`ibm-anyuid-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you:
* Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy

  name: ibm-ace-psp
spec:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: true

```

## Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints [`ibm-anyuid-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart. If your target namespace is not bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can bind it with the following command:

`oc adm policy add-scc-to-group ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccounts:<namespace>` For example, for release into the `default` namespace:
``` 
oc adm policy add-scc-to-group ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccounts:default
```

## Installing the Chart

Only one dashboard can be installed per namespace.

**Important:** If using a private Docker registry, an image pull secret needs to be created before installing the chart. Supply the name of the secret as the value for `image.pullSecret`.

To install the chart with the release name `ace-demo-ingress`:

```
helm install --name ace-demo-ingress ibm-ace-dashboard-dev --tls
```

## Verifying the Chart

See the instructions (from NOTES.txt, packaged with the chart) after the helm installation completes for chart verification. The instructions can also be viewed by running the command:
```
helm status ace-demo-ingress --tls.
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `ace-demo-ingress` release:

```
helm delete ace-demo-ingress --purge --tls
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

## Storage
The IBM App Connect Enterprise dashboard requires a persistent volume to store runtime artefacts used by an IBM App Connect Enterprise integration server. The default size of the persistent volume claim is 5Gi. Configure the size with the `persistence.size` option to scale with the number and size of runtime artefacts that are expected to be uploaded to IBM App Connect Enterprise dashboard.

The persistent volume claim must have an access mode of ReadWriteMany (RWX), and must not use "hostPath" or "local" volumes.

For volumes that support ownership management, specify the group ID of the group owning the persistent volumes' file systems using the `security.fsGroupGid` parameter.

## Resources Required

This chart has the following resource requirements per pod by default:

- 200m CPU core
- 512 Mi memory

See the [configuration](#configuration) section for how to configure these values.

## Logging

The `log.format` value controls whether the format of the output logs is:
- basic: Human-readable format intended for use in development, such as when viewing through `kubectl logs`
- json: Provides more detailed information for viewing through Kibana

## Limitations

 The dashboard is not supported on Safari running on either macOS or iOS.
