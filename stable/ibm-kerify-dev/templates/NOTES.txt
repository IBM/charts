Check the test report:
   1. Before the test report is generated, it may take up some time (30min to 1hour)
   to complete the test suites, please wait for the completion and once the test is
   complete, the message "Report successfully generated to allure-report" will be shown

   2. To view the report, paste the following in a terminal:

    export REPORT_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services {{ template "fullname" . }}-svc)

    export REPORT_IP=$(kubectl get po <pod_name> -o wide --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} --no-headers |awk '{print $7}')

   3. Open your web browser at http://${REPORT_IP}:${REPORT_PORT}, an allure report will be displayed

   4. If the passing rate is not 100% in the test report, please connect us through slack channel #ibm-icp-kerify-dev for further investigation

Note:
   while reviewing the logs, you may see the known exception "...Unrecognized field "classname"..." which can be safely ignored.
