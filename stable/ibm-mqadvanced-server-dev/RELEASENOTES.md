# Breaking Changes

- Now runs as user ID 888. If you are upgrading from a previous release, you need to set `security.initVolumeAsRoot` to `true` to enable changes to persistent file ownership.  You should then perform another upgrade to remove this setting.
- You must now create a new [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) in the target namespace that contains the 'admin' user password and optionally the 'app' user password to use for messaging.  If you are upgrading from a previous release, you need to set `queueManager.dev.secret.name` to the `name` of your new secret and `queueManager.dev.secret.adminPasswordKey` to the secret `key` that contains the 'admin' user password.  If you previously also set an 'app' user password you must set `queueManager.dev.secret.appPasswordKey` to the secret `key` that contains the 'app' user password.
- MQSC files supplied will be verified before being run. Files containing invalid MQSC will cause the container to fail to start.
