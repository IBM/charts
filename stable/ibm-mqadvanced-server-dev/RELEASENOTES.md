# Breaking Changes

- To upgrade from an existing 9.1.4 Queue Manager, you will need to add the 888 group as a supplemental group prior to the upgrade. This is to allow file permissions to be updated in line with no longer running as a user in the MQM group. To upgrade from an existing installation called `my-release`, you can upgrade with the following command:
```
helm upgrade --reuse-values my-release ibm-stable-charts/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev --version 5.0.0 --set security.context.supplementalGroups={888} && \
helm upgrade my-release ibm-stable-charts/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev --version 6.0.0
```

*This assumes that you have previously added the stable Helm repository as a remote Helm repository. If you have not yet added the entitled Helm repository as a remote Helm repository, you can do so by running the following command:*
```
helm repo add ibm-stable-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/stable
```

To remove the 888 supplemental group from your upgraded Helm release, you can run the following command:
```
helm upgrade --reuse-values my-release ibm-stable-charts/ibm-mqadvanced-server-dev --version 6.0.0 --set security.context.supplementalGroups={}
```
