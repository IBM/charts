To access the running pod, run: `kubectl exec -it <PODNAME> bash`

To find the PODNAME, run: `kubectl get pod -l app={{ template "fullname" . }}`

If you enabled persistence, you can get the list of pvc by running `kubectl get pvc`.


Accept the PowerAI License Agreement

    Read the license agreement and accept the terms and conditions before using any of the frameworks.

    $ sudo /opt/DL/license/bin/accept-powerai-license.sh

Getting Started with MLDL Frameworks

    Most of the PowerAI packages install outside the normal system search paths (to /opt/DL/...), so each framework package provides a shell script to simplify environment setup (e.g. PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PYTHONPATH).

    To activate a framework run the following:

    $ source /opt/DL/<framework>/bin/<framework>-activate

    Each framework also provides a test script to verify basic function:

    $ <framework>-test
