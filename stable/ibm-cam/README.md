# Cloud Automation Manager Helm Chart

IBM Cloud Automation Manager is a cloud management solution for deploying cloud infrastructure in multiple clouds with an optimized user experience.

## Introduction

IBM Cloud Automation Manager uses open source Terraform to manage and deliver cloud infrastructure as code. Cloud infrastructure delivered as code is reusable, able to be placed under version control, shared across distributed teams, and it can be used to easily replicate environments.

The IBM Cloud Automation Manager content library comes pre-populated with sample templates to help you get started quickly. Use the sample templates as is or customize them as needed.  A Chef runtime environment can also be deployed using IBM Cloud Automation Manager for more advanced application configuration and deployment.

With IBM Cloud Automation Manager, you can provision cloud infrastructure and accelerate application delivery into IBM Cloud, Amazon EC2, VMware vSphere, VMware NSXv, VMware NSX-T, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM PureApplication, OpenStack and Huawei cloud environments with a single user experience.

You can spend more time building applications and less time building environments when cloud infrastructure is delivered with automation. You are able to get started fast with pre-built infrastructure from the IBM Cloud Automation Manager library.

## Chart Details

This chart deploys IBM Cloud Automation Manager as a number of deployments, services and a security policy.  Images are based on the Universal Base Image (UBI) and are supported to run on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.  

## Prerequisites

IBM Cloud Automation Manager is supported to run in IBM Cloud Private or Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. 

The following IBM Cloud Private platform services are required (inculding when running on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform) - `auth-idp`, `catalog-ui`, `cert-manager`, `helm-api`, `helm-repo`, `icp-management-ingress`, `logging`, `metering`, `monitoring`, `nginx-ingress`, `platform-ui`, `service-catalog`, `tiller`

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy (on IBM Cloud Private) which is used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart.  It is based on the predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: [`ibm-anyuid-hostpath-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) with additional restrictions. 

During installation of the chart, the chart itself will install the following PodSecurityPolicy:

- Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
```

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart defines a custom SecurityContextConstraints (on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform) which is used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart.  It is based on the predefined SecurityContextConstraint name: [`ibm-anyuid-hostpath-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) with additional restrictions. 

During installation of the chart, the chart itself will install the following SecurityContextConstraint:

- Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:
```
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and allow host path access."
