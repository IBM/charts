# Cloud Automation Manager Helm Chart

IBM Cloud Automation Manager is a cloud management solution on IBM Cloud Private (ICP) for deploying cloud infrastructure in multiple clouds with an optimized user experience.

## Introduction

IBM Cloud Automation Manager uses open source Terraform to manage and deliver cloud infrastructure as code. Cloud infrastructure delivered as code is reusable, able to be placed under version control, shared across distributed teams, and it can be used to easily replicate environments.

The Cloud Automation Manager content library comes pre-populated with sample templates to help you get started quickly. Use the sample templates as is or customize them as needed.  A Chef runtime environment can also be deployed using CAM for more advanced application configuration and deployment.

With Cloud Automation Manager, you can provision cloud infrastructure and accelerate application delivery into IBM Cloud, Amazon EC2, VMware vSphere, VMware NSXv, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, IBM PureApplication and OpenStack cloud environments with a single user experience.

You can spend more time building applications and less time building environments when cloud infrastructure is delivered with automation. You are able to get started fast with pre-built infrastructure from the Cloud Automation Manager library.
