Release {{ .Release.Name }} installation finished successfully.

You can check the status by running:
    helm status {{ .Release.Name }} --tls

Verify that all the pods are running. You can monitor the pod status by using:
    kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -w

When all the pods are running, you can perform sanity test:
    helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls

If needed, you can:
    1. Define more Kubernetes storage classes, in addition to the default storage class.

    2. Use the IBM Storage Enabler for Containers for creating persistent volume claims (PVCs) on IBM storage systems.
