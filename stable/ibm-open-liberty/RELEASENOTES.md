## Known Issues

1. Upgrade from all versions except v1.0.0 is supported.
1. If upgrading using the ICP console from earlier chart releases, you must re-specify all custom configuration values you specified in the previous deployment.  Otherwise only default values are applied to the upgrade. 
1. If your application uses IIOP, you must remove the iiopEndpoint configuration from your server.xml before building the Docker image you intend to deploy via this Helm chart. Failure to do so will prevent port values you specify through this Helm chart from overriding those specified in your server.xml. 
1. If your deployment enables IIOP and/or JMS endpoints, they will be erroneously displayed in the Launch button dropdown on the Helm Releases page of the ICP console. The Launch button only works with HTTP/S endpoints, so launching IIOP or JMS endpoints obviously will result in errors. 
1. If you enable ingress during deployment _and_ specify a host value, the Launch button will return error 404. 
1. If deploying to the IBM Kubernetes Service on the IBM Public Cloud, you can only create one ingress resource per host. 
1. The createClusterSSLConfiguration option is not supported on z/Linux. To use the useClusterSSLConfiguration option for a deployment targeting z/Linux, you must first do a deployment on a non-z/Linux node in the same cluster, specifying the createClusterSSLConfiguration option in order to establish the cluster-scope SSL configuration.
1. When upgrading the helm chart release on ICP 3.1.x with helm cli v2.9.1, the following [issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/4337) may be encountered.

## Limitations 

The chart does not yet provide an out of the box secure configuration for the /metrics endpoint.  The /metrics endpoint is served only via HTTP without authentication since prometheus in IBM Cloud Private is not able to scrape secured endpoints at this time.
