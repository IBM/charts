## Chart Details

This chart deploys a single IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers integration server into a Kubernetes environment.

## Prerequisites

No prerequisites

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `rel1`:

```
helm install --name rel1 ibm-ace-dev --set license=accept
```

This command accepts the [IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers license](LICENSE) and deploys an IBM App Connect Enterprise for Developers server on the Kubernetes cluster. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release=rel1`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `rel1` release:

```
helm delete rel1
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart.
