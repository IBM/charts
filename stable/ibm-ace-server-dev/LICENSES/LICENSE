LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs (Z125-5589-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM App Connect Enterprise - Developer Edition V11.0 (5724-J05)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program, alone or in combination with other services or products, in support of any of the following high risk activities: design, construction, control, or maintenance of nuclear facilities, mass transit systems, air traffic control systems, automotive control systems, weapons systems, or aircraft navigation or communications, or any other activity where program failure could give rise to a material threat of death or serious personal injury.

Supporting Programs

The Program is licensed as a multi-product package and includes the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement and within the limits of the Proofs of Entitlement for the Program (unless broader rights are provided elsewhere in this License Information document). The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would include only those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting or Bundled Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. Licensee is not authorized to transfer or remarket the Supporting Programs separate from the Principal Program. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. When Licensee's right to use the Program expires or terminates, Licensee must discontinue use, destroy or promptly return all copies of the Supporting Programs to the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee downloaded the Supporting Programs, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee wishes to license the Supporting Programs for any use beyond the limits set forth above, please contact an IBM Sales Representative or the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program to obtain the appropriate license.

The following are Supporting Programs licensed with the Program:
- IBM Support Assistant Data Collector V2.0.1
- IBM WebSphere Adapter for JD Edwards EnterpriseOne V7.5
- IBM WebSphere Adapter for PeopleSoft Enterprise V7.5
- IBM WebSphere Adapter for SAP Software V7.5

Developer Limitation

If the Program is designated as for "Developers", the Program can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development and unit testing on a developer machine. A developer machine is a physical or virtual desktop environment, running a primary operating system and the Program, both of which are accessible and used by no more than one specified developer. Licensee is not authorized to use the Program for processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Program for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.

Separately Licensed Code

The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the extent they are held to be invalid or unenforceable under the law that governs this license. Each of the components listed below is considered "Separately Licensed Code". IBM Separately Licensed Code is licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program. Notwithstanding any of the terms in the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, the terms of such third party license agreement(s) governs Licensee's use of all Separately Licensed Code unless otherwise noted below.

Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in another NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee has read and agrees to the license agreements contained in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s). If Licensee does not agree to the terms of these third party license agreements, Licensee may not use the Separately Licensed Code.

For Programs acquired under the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") or International Program License Agreement for Non Warranted Program ("ILAN") and Licensee is the original licensee of the Program, if Licensee does not agree with the third party license agreements, Licensee may return the Program in accordance with the terms of, and within the specified time frames stated in, the "Money-back Guarantee" section of the IPLA or ILAN IBM Agreement.

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM:
(a) IBM provides this Separately Licensed Code to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND;
(b) IBM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE;
(c) IBM is not liable to Licensee, and will not defend, indemnify, or hold Licensee harmless for any claims arising from or related to the Separately Licensed Code; and
(d) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code.

Notwithstanding these exclusions, in Germany and Austria, IBM's warranty and liability for the Separately Licensed Code is governed only by the respective terms applicable for Germany and Austria in IBM license agreements.

Note: IBM may provide limited support for some Separately Licensed Code. If such support is available, the details and any additional terms related to such support will be set forth in the License Information document.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Third Party Operating Systems

For the convenience of Licensee, the Program may be accompanied by a third party operating system. The operating system is not part of the Program, and is licensed directly by the operating system provider (e.g., Red Hat Inc., Novell Inc., etc.) to Licensee. IBM is not a party to the license between Licensee and the third party operating system provider, and includes the third party operating system "AS IS", without representation or warranty, express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

Third Party Data and Services

The Program may contain links to or be used to access third party data services, databases, web services, software, or other third party content (all, "content"). Access to this content is provided "AS-IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Access can be terminated by the relevant third parties at their sole discretion at any time. Licensee may be required to enter into separate agreements with the third parties for the access to or use of such content. IBM is not a party to any such separate agreements and as an express condition of this license Licensee agrees to comply with the terms of such separate agreements.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1. Components Not Used for Establishing Required Entitlements

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program and components are not taken into consideration. In other words, Licensee may install and use the following Program and components, under the license terms, but these components are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.

Use of the Program and Components when used for Development and Functional Test purposes:

Under Development and Functional Test use, the Program or components can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development, unit, and functional testing environments. In functional test environments the developer can integrate their code with that of others on shared use machines, and that code can be tested in a test harness. Functional testing is limited to ensuring that the Program can be used to connect to local or remote endpoints, and that a sample of data sent between those endpoints is processed correctly. Licensee is not authorized to use the Program or components for system test, meaning integrated code is tested as a product, processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing the scalability of any code, application or system.

Idle Standby configurations

"Idle Standby" configuration is one where a copy of the Program is installed on a server which forms part of a high availability solution and is the server to which the Program will fail over in the event that the copy of the Program on the active server ceases to be usable. A server is only considered "idle" if, until a failover takes place, it is used exclusively for administrative actions that assist in failover scenarios.

If the Program is used in an Idle Standby configuration with the Program's multi-instance mode, then a copy of the Program may reside for backup purposes on an Idle Standby server, and started, but must remain "idle" and not be used to carry out productive work of any kind unless the active server fails over on to the Idle Standby server, in which event the Idle Standby copy may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover.

If the Program is used in an Idle Standby configuration with other High Availability systems, then a copy of the Program may reside for backup purposes on an Idle Standby server but not started (and therefore not be used to carry out productive work of any kind), but will be started automatically by the High Availability components in the event of the active server failing, in which event the Idle Standby copy may be used to carry out productive work during the period of failover.

2. Operation mode

The Program is capable of running in different operational modes, with associated restrictions, which are detailed in the "Operation Modes" and the "Restrictions that apply in each operation mode" sections of the Program's Knowledge Center, which is provided by IBM in the English, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Japanese and Spanish languages. The term Execution Group (used below) is defined in the "Technical Overview" section of the Program's Knowledge Center.

In Standard mode, all features are enabled for use with a single Execution Group. The number of message flows that Licensee can deploy is unlimited.

By default, the Program runs in the Advanced mode; see the "Operation Modes" section of the Program's Information Center for details of how to change the Program's operational mode, using the 'mqsimode' command.

The entitlement to use each operational mode must be acquired separately, and it is Licensee's obligation to ensure that the Program is not running in an operational mode with more functionality (or with fewer restrictions) than the operational mode entitlement which Licensee has acquired.

3. Supporting Program Details

IBM Support Assistant Data Collector
- Support: Nonsupported

"Nonsupported" means the Supporting Program is provided without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

4. Distributable Microsoft Code

The distribution of the Program that is released for Microsoft Windows operating systems contains some distributable code (source code and DLLs) from Microsoft Corporation ('Microsoft Code').

Licensee may not exploit any distributable Microsoft Code (i.e., source code and DLLs), unless Licensee separately downloads (or otherwise properly obtains) its own copy of the Microsoft source and DLLs directly from Microsoft. Licensee will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Microsoft license that accompanies such Microsoft source code and DLLs (and not the terms and conditions of this license), which will apply to the use and distribution (if any) by Licensee of such material downloaded or otherwise by Licensee.

The Program contains sample source code that is derived from the distributable Microsoft Code in source code form. Licensee must not include any such sample source code derived from distributable Microsoft Code in any malicious, deceptive or unlawful program.
