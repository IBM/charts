# Breaking Changes

When using the ACE & MQ image:
  * This runs as user ID 888. If you are upgrading from a previous release, you need to set security.initVolumeAsRoot to true to enable changes to persistent file ownership. You should then perform another upgrade to remove this setting.
  * MQSC files supplied will be verified before being run. Files containing invalid MQSC will cause the container to fail to start.
* When upgrading from previous versions, if values for paramters are copied, some parameters will need to be manually updated to match your existing deployment.

| Previous parameter  | Current parameter                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| fsGroupGid          | integrationServer.fsGroupGid          |
| configurationSecret | integrationServer.configurationSecret |
| replicaCount        | aceonly.replicaCount                  |
| queueManager.name   | acemq.qmname                          |
