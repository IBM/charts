# Introduction

This chart deploys a single IBM Integration Bus for Developers integration node, containing a single integration server into an IBM Cloud Private or other Kubernetes environment.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `rel1`:

```bash
helm install --name rel1 ibm-integration-bus-dev --set license=accept
```

This command accepts the [IBM Integration Bus for Developers license](LICENSE) and deploys an IBM Integration Bus for Developers server on the Kubernetes cluster. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release=rel1`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `rel1` release:

```bash
helm delete rel1
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart.

## Configuration
The following table lists the configurable parameters of the `ibm-integration-bus-dev` chart and their default values.
