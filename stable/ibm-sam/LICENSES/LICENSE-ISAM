==============================================

IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.

CentOS

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Export and Import Restrictions

This Program may contain cryptography. Transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. restrictions on exports or reexports. To obtain the export classification of this Program refer to: https://www.ibm.com/products/exporting/.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the PVU Table by Processor Vendor, Brand, Type and Model Number at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program using either Full Capacity licensing or Virtualization Capacity (Sub-Capacity) licensing according to the Passport Advantage Sub-Capacity Licensing Terms (see webpage below). If using Full Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores* in the physical hardware environment made available to or managed by the Program, except for those servers from which the Program has been permanently removed. If using Virtualization Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores made available to or managed by the Program, as defined according to the Virtualization Capacity License Counting Rules at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/Counting_Software_licenses_using_specific_virtualization_technologies.html.

* An Activated processor core is a processor core that is available for use in a physical or virtual server, regardless of whether the capacity of the processor core can be or is limited through virtualization technologies, operating system commands, BIOS settings, or similar restrictions.

User Value Unit (UVU)

User Value Unit (UVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. UVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number and type of Users for the given Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of UVUs required for Licensee's environment as specified in the table below. The UVU entitlements are specific to the Program and type of user and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with UVU entitlements of another program or type of user.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

The Users for the purposes of UVU calculation are the sum of all Internal Users, External Users, and Infrequent Users given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program.

- An Internal User is a unique person that is given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program and is an employee of the Licensee or a contractor performing work on behalf of the Licensee. Each Internal User equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units.
- An External User is a unique person that is given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program and is not an employee of the Licensee or a contractor performing work on behalf of the Licensee. A ratio of fifteen External Users equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units.
- An Infrequent Internal User is an Internal User who accesses the Program or whose access is managed by the Program less than five times a year. A ratio of fifteen Infrequent Internal Users equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units.
- Each Internal, External and Infrequent Internal User must be trackable and auditable.

User Definitions for Service Provider

If the Licensee is a Service Provider as defined in the International Passport Advantage or the International Passport Advantage Express Agreement, the UVU calculation must be based upon the following:
- For each end user customer of the Service Provider, an Internal User is a unique person that is given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program through or as part of the Service Provider's information technology service, and is an employee of the end user customer or a contractor performing work on behalf of the end user customer. Each Internal User equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units.
- For each end user customer of the Service Provider, an External User is a unique person that is given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program through or as part of the Service Provider's information technology service, and is not an employee of the end user customer or a contractor performing work on behalf of the end user customer. A ratio of fifteen External Users equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units. 
- For each end user customer of the Service Provider, an Infrequent Internal User is an Internal User that is given access to the Program or whose access is managed by the Program through or as part of the Service Provider's information technology service less than five times per year. A ratio of fifteen Infrequent Internal Users equals one User for the purpose of calculating User Value Units.
- For each end user customer of the Service Provider, each Internal, External and Infrequent Internal User must be trackable and auditable.

Users who no longer have access to the Program and whose access is no longer managed by the Program, but whose identities are retained in the user registry for archival and audit purposes, are not counted for purposes of UVU calculation. User identities must be trackable and auditable.

User Value Unit Conversion Table

For 1 to 5,000 Users, 1.00 UVU per User
For 5,001 to 15,000 Users, 5,000 UVUs plus 0.50 UVUs per User above 5,000
For 15,001 to 50,000 Users, 10,000 UVUs plus 0.30 UVUs per User above 15,000
For 50,001 to 150,000 Users, 20,500 UVUs plus 0.20 UVUs per User above 50,000
For 150,001 to 500,000 Users, 40,500 UVUs plus 0.10 UVUs per User above 150,000
For 500,001 to 1,000,000 Users, 75,500 UVUs plus 0.05 UVUs per User above 500,000
For 1,000,001 to 3,000,000 Users, 100,500 UVUs plus 0.025 UVUs per User above 1,000,000
For greater than 3,000,000 Users, 150,500 UVUs plus 0.01 UVUs per User above 3,000,000
