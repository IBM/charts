# Skydive

## Introduction

Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer.
It aims to provide a comprehensive way of understanding what is happening in the network infrastructure.

Skydive agents collect topology informations and flows and forward them to a central agent for further analysis. All the informations are stored in an Elasticsearch database.

Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in order to enhance the topology and flows informations.

## Prerequisites

Skydive requires:
* Kubernetes cluster 1.10.0 or higher

And can run on any one of the following private/hosted platforms:
* IBM Cloud Private 2.1.0.3 or higher
* IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

- Persistent volume is needed only if you want to "look back in time" with skydive (that is, if you are interested in the monitoring history); if you don't , then it is not required (an elastic search container will not be created). You can create a persistent volume via the IBM Cloud Private interface or through a yaml file. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: <persistent volume name>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: <PATH>
```

- Skydive Community Image. Docker Hub container registry docker.io/skydive/*  must be added to the list of trusted registries. First make sure you have the ClusterAdminRole role. Next under an admin role setup image policy:

```
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: skydive-ibmcloud-image-policy
spec:
  repositories:
    - name: docker.io/skydive/*
```
  
  Finally install ibm-skydive-dev using the docker.io/skydive/skydive:tag image.

## Installing the Chart
To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release stable/ibm-skydive-dev
```

The command deploys skydive on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Verifying the Chart
See NOTES.txt associated with this chart for verification instructions

## Uninstalling the Chart
To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Security implications
This chart deploys privileged kubernetes daemon-set. The implications are automatically creation of privileged container per kubernetes node capable of monitoring network and system behavior and used to capture Linux OS level information. The daemon-set also uses hostpath feature interacting with Linux OS, capturing info on network components.

## Configuration
The following tables lists the configurable parameters of skydive chart and their default values.

## Chart Details
Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

## Topology fabric
The chart allows definition of static interfaces and links to be added to skydive topology view by setting the `analyzer.topology.fabric` parameter. This is useful to define external fabric resources like : TOR, Router, etc.
Details on this parameter field are available under the analyzer.topology.Fabric section in the following link: 
[https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/blob/master/etc/skydive.yml.default](https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/blob/master/etc/skydive.yml.default)

## Env
The chart allows definition of extended environment variables to be used by Skydive components. The list of configuration parameters is available on [https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/blob/master/etc/skydive.yml.default](https://github.com/skydive-project/skydive/blob/master/etc/skydive.yml.default). Use upper-case/underline semantics of a configuration parameter prefixed by `SKYDIVE_` to use as an environment variable. For example, to enable debug add to the deployment .yml file:  
```
env:
  # Enable debug
  - name: SKYDIVE_LOGGING_LEVEL
    value: "DEBUG"
```
Environment variables for SkyDive can also be defined using UI. The Env field should be changed, for example:
```
  [{"name":"SKYDIVE_LOGGING_LEVEL","value":"DEBUG"}]
```

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

None

## Resources Required
The chart deploys pods and daemon-set consuming minimum resources as specified in the `resources` configuration parameter (default: Memory: `512Mi`, CPU: `100m`)

## Limitations

Refer to section [Security implications](#security-implications)

## Persistence
Skydive analyzer uses elasticsearch to store data at the `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data` path of the Analyzer container.

The chart mounts a [Persistent Volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) at this location. User needs to create a PV before chart deployed, or enable dynamic volume provisioning in chart configuration.

To make Elasticsearch work properly the user needs to set kernel setting vm.max_map_count to at least 262144 on each worker node. Please check
