Thank you for installing: {{ .Chart.Name }}.   Your release is named: {{ .Release.Name }}

1. Verify that plugin pods are in "Running" state:

    kubectl get pods -n {{ template "ibm-object-storage-plugin.namespace" . }} -o wide | grep object

   The installation is successful when you see one `ibmcloud-object-storage-plugin` pod and one or more `ibmcloud-object-storage-driver` pods.
   The number of `ibmcloud-object-storage-driver` pods equals the number of worker nodes in your cluster. All pods must be in a `Running` state
   for the plug-in to function properly. If the pods fail, run `kubectl describe pod -n {{ template "ibm-object-storage-plugin.namespace" . }} <pod_name>`
   to find the root cause for the failure.

2. Verify that the storage classes are created successfully:

    kubectl get storageclass | grep 'ibmc-s3fs'
