# What’s new in Chart Version 1.13.0

## Microclimate
* Added support for IBM Cloud Private Version 3.2
* Added support for multiple build and multiple application logs.
* Added support for custom template creation. 

# Fixes
* Various minor bug and stability fixes.


# Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud Private Version 3.1.2 or 3.2. Version 3.1.1 is supported in chart versions 1.11.0 and 1.12.0. Version 3.1.0 is supported in chart version 1.6.0 to 1.10.0. Version support information can be found in the release notes of each chart release.
- Ensure [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/README) is available on all worker nodes in your cluster. Microclimate uses Helm internally, and both the Helm Tiller and client require socat for port forwarding.
- Download the IBM Cloud Private CLI, `cloudctl`, from your cluster at the `https://<your-cluster-ip>:8443/console/tools/cli` URL.


# Upgrading from 1.12.0

Microclimate can be upgraded from the IBM Cloud Private Helm Releases view. When performing the upgrade, ensure the `Reuse Value` option is selected.

If you are upgrading with Helm from the command line, you should pass the same values into the Helm upgrade command that you initially installed the chart with to ensure configuration remains the same. It is recommended that you retrieve these values and store them for the upgrade by using the following command with your Microclimate release name:

`helm get values <release-name> > values.yaml`

You can then perform the upgrade with the following command:

`helm upgrade <release-name> <path-to-microclimate-chart> -f values.yaml`
