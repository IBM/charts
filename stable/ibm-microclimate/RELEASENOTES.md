# Breaking Changes
The chart for Version 1.6.0 works only with IBM Cloud Private Version 3.1.0. IBM Cloud Private Version 2.1.0.3 and 2.1.0.2 are not supported.

# What’s new in Chart Version 1.6.0

## Microclimate
* Added support for IBM Cloud Private Version 3.1.0.
* Improved the iterative development model for Spring projects. Also made code updates are faster.
* Secured internal communications with HTTPS.
* Modified project deletion to be asynchronous. As a result, the loading screen does not stall while Microclimate deletes a project.
* Limited the number of concurrent builds to prevent performance degradation when too many builds start at once. The default limit is three.
* Added flexible language support. Also Microclimate can import, build, and deploy generic Docker type projects. The additional languages show up when you create a new project. 
* Added the **Validate** page to the **Overview** page. The **Validate** page can be viewed during project development.
* Added support for logging out of IBM Cloud Private installations of Microclimate.
* The Acme Air sample application runs in Microclimate with the Java Liberty runtime.

## Pipeline
* Added support for creating more than one pipeline that automatically deploys the last good build to a specified environment.
* Added support for specifying a namespace for a deployment to the local cluster.
* Added ability to override the name that is provided to the Helm release that is associated with a deployment.
* Added ability to deploy different branches to different namespaces. A selectable list of branches, as found in the target Git repository, is provided.
* Deleting a deployment now also deletes the deployed application.


## Chart
* Updates to support IBM Cloud Private Version 3.1.0.
* Changed certificate for Jenkins and Portal ingress to a certificate signed by ICP.
* Added create of Jenkins target namespace if it doesn't already exist.
* Added check to see if target namespace exists.
* Improved appearance of metadata values in catalog configure page.
* Simplified installation into a non-default namespace. ClusterRole and ClusterRole bindings are now created automatically.
* Added support for including additional imagePullSecrets via the IBM Cloud Private catalog.


# Fixes
* Various minor bug and stability fixes.


# Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud Private Version 3.1.0. Older versions of IBM Cloud Private are supported only by chart versions v1.5.0 and earlier. Version support information can be found in the release notes of each chart release.
- Ensure [socat](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/doc/README) is available on all worker nodes in your cluster. Microclimate uses Helm internally, and both the Helm Tiller and client require socat for port forwarding.
- Download the IBM Cloud Private CLI, `cloudctl`, from your cluster at the `https://<your-cluster-ip>:8443/console/tools/cli` URL.


## Upgrading Microclimate to v1.6.0

To upgrade to Microclimate v1.6.0:
1. Obtain information about current persistent volumes so that they can be retained in the new installation.
1. Uninstall Microclimate.
1. Upgrade IBM Cloud Private to Version 3.1.0.
1. Install Micrcolimate with the persitent volumes.

More details are provided in the following sections:

### Identify which PersistentVolumes the existing Microclimate deployment is currently using
Microclimate will be using two PersistentVolumes: one for the main Microclimate deployment and one for the  Jenkins deployment. These can be found by using `kubectl describe deploy <deploymentName> | grep "ClaimName"` on each of the  deployments to find the name of the PersistentVolumeClaim being used; followed by using `kubectl describe pvc <pvcName> | grep "Volume"` to find the name of the PersistentVolume that the claim is bound to. Repeat this step for both the Microclimate and Jenkins deployments.

Keep note of these PV names for the following steps.

### Ensure the Reclaim Policy is set to 'Retain' on both PersistentVolumes
To ensure your Microclimate data is retained during the migration, you need to ensure the PersistentVolume doesn't get deleted or recycled by setting their Reclaim Policies to `Retain`. To check the policy of a Persistent Volume, use `kubectl get pv <pvName> -o yaml | grep persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy`. If the policy is set to anything other than 'Retain', you can set this value using the following command:

`kubectl patch pv <pvName> -p '{"spec":{"persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy":"Retain"}}'`

Repeat this step for both the Microclimate and Jenkins PersistentVolumes.

### Take note of capacity used by the existing Microclimate PersistentVolumeClaim

Because the default PVC size of Microclimate has changed, you will need to ensure you set the PVC size when re-installing Microclimate to ensure the Microclimate PVC binds to the PV correctly. To find this value, use the following command:

`kubectl describe pvc <pvcName> | grep "Capacity"`

Use this to find the capacity of both the Microclimate and Jenkins PVCs

### Uninstall Microclimate

**IMPORTANT** Ensure the previous steps have been completed - otherwise you may risk losing your Microclimate data

Uninstall Microclimate using Helm using the release name you installed Microclimate with: `helm delete --purge <releaseName>`. This will remove all of the Microclimate components including the PersistentVolumeClaims and should leave behind the PersistentVolumes in a `Released` state. To confirm this, do `kubectl get pv` and you should see both of the Microclimate PersistentVolumes left behind with their status set to `Released` and still have a `Claim` associated to them.

### Removing existing claim references from the PersistentVolumes

Your PVs may still contain references to the old PVCs that were bound to them previously which are stored in a section of each PV spec called `claimRef`. You will need to delete this from each PV to allow the new Microclimate PVCs to bind to them.

For both the Microclimate and Jenkins PersistentVolumes, carry out the following steps:

1. Use `kubectl edit pv <pv-name>` to begin editing the PV. By default, this will open ‘vi’ for Linux or ‘notepad’ for Windows. To learn how to use a different editor, view the documentation for `kubectl edit` [here](https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_edit/)

2. Identify the `claimRef` in the PV spec. It should look similar to the following:

```
claimRef:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    name: ...
    namespace: ...
    resourceVersion: ...
    uid: ...
```

3. Delete this section from the PV, save the changes and exit the editor. If this was successful, you should see the message `persistentvolume "<pv-name>" edited` and using `kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o yaml`.

4. Verify that the PV is now available. Using `kubectl get pv <pv-name>` should show the PV with an `Available` status and with an empty claim field.

### Reinstall Microclimate after upgrading to IBM Cloud Private Verion 3.1.0

After you upgrade your cluster, you follow the installation steps in the README file. These steps have been updated specifically for Version 3.1.0. In addition to these installation steps, you need to set the persistence.size value to the value of the Microclimate PVC you recorded in the earlier steps to ensure a new PVC gets created, which binds to your previous Microclimate PV." 

For example, you `helm install` command may look like this:

`helm install --name microclimate --set persistence.size=<pvcCapacity> --set hostName=<MICROCLIMATE_INGRESS> --set jenkins.Master.HostName=<JENKINS_INGRESS> --set <any-other-values> ibm-charts/ibm-microclimate`

If Microclimate doesn't bind to the correct PV, you might need to manually create a PVC to bind to the PV and reinstall Microclimate and provide the PVC name in the `persistence.existingClaimName` value.

For more information on setting installation values, read the **Configuring Microclimate** section of the README.
