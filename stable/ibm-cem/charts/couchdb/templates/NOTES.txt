## Planning for Scaling
Couchdb uses the default sharding value of 8 shards and 3 replicas.
This allows each database to take advantage of up to 24 nodes.
As the number of databases increases the cluster will be able to spread data
across even more nodes.
You can modify these settings by changing numShards and numReplicas in
values.yaml.
Review the couchdb documentation to verify whether these settings are suitable
for your set-up.
