      # This may require manual PV creation by the Cloud Administrators, for example creating "local-storage" PVs.
      # Cassandra data consists of potentially large SSTable files.
      # Writes will be very sequential IO.
      # Compaction of SSTables will be sequential reads and writes.
      # Reads for time series data will generally be sequential.
      # Workloads with many small reads could create random IO requests, if the requests are not able to be fulfilled from memory.
      # In general, HDDs are acceptable for Cassandra due to the sequential nature of the IO.
      # It is recommended though to have multiple drives in a raid array based on the number of threads to allow for concurrent reads/writes.
      # SSDs will have the best performance, but due to the size of large time series data in Cassandra could be cost prohibitive.
