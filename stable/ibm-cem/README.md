## Prerequisites

* IBM Cloud Private 2.1.0.3 or higher
* Cluster admin privilege is required for OIDC registration, cluster security policies and service broker
* The default storage class is used.  See the Storage section below.

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements
This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name: ibm-restricted-psp has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom PodSecurityPolicy using the ICP user interface or the supplied instructions/scripts in the pak_extension pre-install directory.

- From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom PodSecurityPolicy
  - Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is the most restrictive, 
          requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host." 
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: runtime/default
        apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: runtime/default

    ```
  - Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ibm-restricted-psp-clusterrole
    rules:

      resourceNames:
      - ibm-restricted-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    ```


## Resources Required
#### System resources, based on default install parameters.
* Minimum: 8GB Memory and 4 CPU
* Recommended: 16GB Memory and 18 CPU

The CPU resource is measured in Kuberenetes _cpu_ units. See Kubernetes documentation for details.  

#### Persistence:
* Cassandra will need 108GB of disk space
* Other components will need an additional 4GB

| `global.persistence.storageSize.datalayerjobs` | data layer jobs storage size option| 
| `global.ingress.domain` | Domain must be set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the CEM service. This FQDN must resolve to the IP address of the ICp proxy host running the ingress controller.  This normally requires a DNS entry, for testing /etc/hosts on any client host may be updated.| 
| `global.ingress.tlsSecret` | If tlsSecret is the empty string CEM will use the default TLS certificate installed on the ingress controller. If this certificate does not match the value of Domain browsers and other clients will raise security warnings. For production use a TLS certificate for the FQDN should be obtained from a well known certificate authority and installed in a TLS secret in the namespace. tlsSecret must be set to the name of this secret.| 
| `global.ingress.prefix` | If multiple releases of CEM are installed in a single ICp each should be given a different FQDN, and each should have a TLS certificate installed. If the same FQDN is used for each release, or tlsSecret is left empty for any release, global.ingress.prefix may be used to give each a different path.  E.g. if global.ingress.domain is 'cem.example.com' and global.ingress.prefix is 'mycem/', the UI end point will be https://cem.example.com/mycem/cemui.| 
| `global.ingress.port` | If installing into an ingress controller that has a specified port number that is different than the default (443), then the port number can be specified here. Normally, this port should be the default value.| 
| `watsonworkspace` | Watson Workspace Outgoing Integration Configuration| 
| `watsonworkspace.appid` | After creating a Watson Workspace application that CEM can integrate with, provide the Watson Workspace application ID to send outgoing notifications.| 
| `watsonworkspace.appsecret` | After creating a Watson Workspace application that CEM can integrate with, provide the Watson Workspace application secret to send outgoing notifications.| 
| `watsonworkspace.sharetoken` | After creating a Watson Workspace application that CEM can integrate with, provide the Watson Workspace application share token to send outgoing notifications.| 
| `cemservicebroker` | CEM Service Broker Configuration| 
| `cemservicebroker.suffix` | If multiple Cloud Event Management products are installed causing multiple cluster service broker registrations, a suffix will be required to separate out the instances so more than one cluster service broker can be registered within a single ICp environment. If not specified, no suffix will be added to the cluster service broker registered service.| 


_NOTE:_

1. Valid values for `global.environmentSize` are `size0` and `size1`. `size0` specifies a minimal resource footprint for development and test purposes, while `size1` is intended for production systems with a larger footprint.

2. If this is left empty the default TLS certificate installed on the Ingress Controller is used.

## Storage

* If the default storage class is glusterfs then Persistent Volumes will be dynamically provisioned.
* If you require a non-default storage class, update the persistance.storageClassName to the storage class name. Alternatively, set each individual value under global.persistance.storageClassOption to specific persistent volumes.

## Limitations

* These charts can be deployed multiple times in the same namespace under different release names.
* To avoid multiple deployments in the same namespace, install one instance per namespace, and deploy multiple namespaces for ease of management and separation of resources.
