# IBM Cloud Event Management Community Edition

## Introduction
* Use the IBMÂ® Cloud Event Management Community Edition service to set up real-time incident management for your services, applications, and infrastructure.
* Restore service and resolve operational incidents fast!
* Empower your DevOps teams to correlate different sources of events into actionable incidents, synchronize teams, and automate incident resolution.
* The service sets you on course to achieve efficient and reliable operational health, service quality and continuous improvement.
* Community (experimental) and enterprise (standard) editions are both available either through the IBM Cloud Private catalog or Passport Advantage,  respectively. The community edition is a non-expiring, limited use version, but is fully upgradable to the enterprise version after installation with minimal data loss.

## Prerequisites

* IBM Cloud Private 3.2
* Cluster admin privilege is required for OIDC registration, cluster security policies and service broker
* The default storage class is used. See the Storage section below.

### Secrets Requirements
#### Email
When configuring ibm-cem to allow authentication with either an SMTP server via a username/password or the SendGrid service via an API key, a secret is required before installation. Run the following command to create the secret with the correct values:

`kubectl create secret generic <release-name>-cem-email-auth-secret --from-literal=smtpuser="***" --from-literal=smtppassword="***" --from-literal=apikey="***"`

*Parameters:*
* smtpuser: SMTP Username
* smtppassword: SMTP Password
* apikey: Sendgrid API key

Note: Email needs to be configured and authentication needs to be enabled via the chart installation configuration. All parameters need to be specified regardless of desired set of credentials.

#### Nexmo
When configuring ibm-cem to allow sms/voice notifications via the Nexmo service, a secret is required before installation. Run the following command to create the secret with the correct values:

`kubectl create secret generic <release-name>-cem-nexmo-auth-secret --from-literal=secret="***" --from-literal=key="***"`

*Parameters:*
* secret: Nexmo Secret
* key: Nexmo API key

Note: Nexmo needs to be configured and enabled via the chart installation configuration. All parameters need to be specified regardless of desired set of credentials.

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements
This chart requires a `PodSecurityPolicy` to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined `PodSecurityPolicy` name: [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this `PodSecurityPolicy` you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom `PodSecurityPolicy` which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom `PodSecurityPolicy` using the IBM Cloud Private management console. Note that this `PodSecurityPolicy` is already defined in IBM Cloud Private 3.1.1 or higher.

- From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom `PodSecurityPolicy` into the create resource section
  - Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is the most restrictive,
          requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."

    ```
  - Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ibm-restricted-psp-clusterrole
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - extensions

      - ibm-restricted-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    ```

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a `SecurityContextConstraints` to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined `SecurityContextConstraints` name: [`ibm-restricted-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this `SecurityContextConstraints` resource you can proceed to install the chart.

#### Creating the required resources

This chart defines a custom `SecurityContextConstraints` which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom `SecurityContextConstraints` resource using the supplied instructions or scripts in the `ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/prereqs` directory.

* From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom `SecurityContextConstraints`
  * Custom `SecurityContextConstraints` definition:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
  kind: SecurityContextConstraints
  metadata:
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is the most restrictive,
        requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."
      cloudpak.ibm.com/version: "1.0.0"

  defaultPrivilegeEscalation: false
  forbiddenSysctls:
    - "*"
  fsGroup:
    type: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - max: 65535
      min: 1
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
  runAsUser:
    type: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seccompProfiles:
  - docker/default
  seLinuxContext:
    type: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    type: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - max: 65535
      min: 1
  volumes:
  - configMap
  - downwardAPI
  - emptyDir
  - persistentVolumeClaim
  - projected
  - secret
  priority: 11 # default anyuid has priority 10
  ```

* From the command line, you can run the setup scripts included under `ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/prereqs` to create namespace and apply `SecurityContextConstraints` to the namespace
  * `ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/prereqs/createSccAndNamespace.sh --namespace [namespace]`

### Resources Required
#### System resources, based on various install size parameters.

Size 0 (Demo/Test)
* Minimum: 8GB Memory and 4 CPU
* Recommended for heavy load: 16GB Memory and 16 CPU (or more)

Size 1 (Production Ready)
* Minimum: 20GB Memory and 14 CPU
* Recommended for heavy load: 32 GB Memory and 32 CPU (or more)

#### Persistence:
* Cassandra will need 108GB of disk space
* Other components will need an additional 4GB

### Encryption and Security
* Data at rest is unencrypted with the exception of personal data stored in couchdb for GDPR compliance. Disk encryption should be used in the event of additional data at rest encryption requirements.
* Data in motion is unencrypted within the cluster from a node-to-node perspective. IPSEC can be enabled and configured at the cluster level in the event of additional data in motion encryption requirements.

| `global.masterPort` | ICP - Master Port | 8443 | 
| `global.masterCA` | If you have provided your own certificate for the IBMÂ® Cloud Private management ingress you must create a ConfigMap containing the certificate authority's certificate in PEM format (e.g kubectl create configmap master-ca --from-file=./ca.pem) and set this value to the name of this ConfigMap. If you have not provided your own certificate leave this value empty. |  | 
| `global.environmentSize` | Controls the resource sizes the value can be either 'size1' or 'size0'. Size0 is a minimal spec for evaluation or development purposes. | size0 | 
| `global.minReplicasHPAs` | Minimum number of replicas that auto scaling will apply to each deployment. This value may be overridden by deployment specific values. | 1 |

| `global.persistence.storageSize.couchdbdata` | couchdb data storage size option | 1Gi | 
| `global.affinity.podAffinity.weight` | Controls the weighting of the requirement to schedule related pods to run close together in order to improve performance. Unless you are using other affinity or anti-affinity rules you do not need to adjust this parameter. | 50 | 
| `global.affinity.podAntiAffinity.weight` | Controls the weighting of the requirement to schedule apart pods running the same service to improve resilience. Unless you are using other affinity or anti-affinity rules you do not need to adjust this parameter. | 50 | 
| `global.ingress.domain` | Domain must be set to the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the CEM service. This FQDN must resolve to the IP address of the IBMÂ® Cloud Private proxy host running the ingress controller.  This normally requires a DNS entry, for testing /etc/hosts on any client host may be updated. |  | 
| `global.ingress.tlsSecret` | If tlsSecret is the empty string CEM will use the default TLS certificate installed on the ingress controller. If this certificate does not match the value of Domain browsers and other clients will raise security warnings. For production use a TLS certificate for the FQDN should be obtained from a well known certificate authority and installed in a TLS secret in the namespace. tlsSecret must be set to the name of this secret. |  | 
| `global.ingress.prefix` | If multiple releases of CEM are installed in a single IBMÂ® Cloud Private each should be given a different FQDN, and each should have a TLS certificate installed. If the same FQDN is used for each release, or tlsSecret is left empty for any release, global.ingress.prefix may be used to give each a different path.  E.g. if global.ingress.domain is 'cem.example.com' and global.ingress.prefix is 'mycem/', the UI end point will be https://cem.example.com/mycem/cemui. |  | 
| `global.ingress.port` | If installing into an ingress controller that has a specified port number that is different than the default (443), then the port number can be specified here. Normally, this port should be the default value. | 443 | 
| `cemservicebroker.suffix` | If multiple Cloud Event Management products are installed causing multiple cluster service broker registrations, a suffix will be required to separate out the instances so more than one cluster service broker can be registered within a single IBMÂ® Cloud Private environment. If not specified, no suffix will be added to the cluster service broker registered service. |  | 
| `icpbroker.adminusername` | The name of the cluster administrator user.  This is the name that will be added to subscriptions  (required for MCM). | admin | 


_NOTE:_

1. Valid values for `global.environmentSize` are `size0` and `size1`. `size0` specifies a minimal resource footprint for development and test purposes, while `size1` is intended for production systems with a larger footprint.

2. If `global.ingress.tlsSecret` is left empty the default TLS certificate installed on the Ingress Controller is used.

## Storage

* If the default storage class is glusterfs then Persistent Volumes will be dynamically provisioned.
* If you require a non-default storage class, update the persistence.storageClassName to the storage class name. Alternatively, set each individual value under global.persistence.storageClassOption to specific persistent volumes.

## Limitations

* These charts can be deployed multiple times in the same namespace under different release names.
* To avoid multiple deployments in the same namespace, install one instance per namespace, and deploy multiple namespaces for ease of management and separation of resources.

## Backup and Restore

You can use Velero to backup your Kubernetes resources. Velero also takes snapshots of your cluster's Persistent Volumes and can restore your cluster's objects and Persistent Volumes to a previous state. For more information on backing up and restoring IBM Cloud Event Management, consult the [Backup and Restore](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSURRN/com.ibm.cem.doc/em_backuprestore.html) topic.

## Scaling and Performance

* Scaling of StatefulSets such as Cassandra, Kafka, and Zookeeper is only supported for high availability requirements and not performance. Scaling of certain StatefulSets up or down may require additional manual steps to fully enable high availability. Refer to the product documentation for additional information.
