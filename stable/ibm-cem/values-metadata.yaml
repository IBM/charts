## Metadata for ibm-cem configuration
## This metadata is used to augment the value.yaml to drive IBM® Cloud Private UI for configuration of the Helm chart installation

# Put properties for the charts in here, and then you can get them out in the templates.
# Notice that the microservice names are a little different here, they don't have dashes. That's because the templating language couldn't handle the - characters.
