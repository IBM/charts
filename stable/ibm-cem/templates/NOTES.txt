Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface: kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running helm tests: helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls --cleanup

3. {{ if .Release.IsUpgrade }}(Optional) {{ end }}OIDC registration with IBM Cloud Private is required to be able to login to IBM Cloud Event Management's UI. As an IBM Cloud Private user with the Cluster Administrator role, run the following kubectl command:
kubectl exec -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -t `kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} | grep "{{ .Release.Name }}-ibm-cem-cem-users" | grep "Running" | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'` bash -- "/etc/oidc/oidc_reg.sh" "`echo $(kubectl get secret platform-oidc-credentials -o yaml -n kube-system | grep OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_SECRET: | awk '{print $2}')`"

4. Service instances
{{  .Values.productName }} is a multi-tenant product and a single installation supports multiple service instances (subscriptions).

{{- if .Release.IsUpgrade -}}
If upgrading the product to enterprise from the community edition version, the existing service instances and their plans will need to be updated. In IBM Cloud Private 2.1.0.3, service plans can only be updated via the command line interface: kubectl edit serviceinstance <name>.  Change the plan names from 'experimental' to 'standard' and save the service instance.

-  From the dashboard catalog, search and select ibm-cloud-evtmgmt-{{ .Release.Name }}.
-  Under plans, select the {{ if .Values.productName }}{{ if eq .Values.productName "IBM Cloud Event Management" }}standard{{ else }}experimental{{ end }}{{ end }} option, and Configure
-  Provide an instance name, ensuring it does not start with a number or capital letter.
-  From the drop down list select a namespace, and select Deploy.

5. Follow the instructions below to access your service instances:
