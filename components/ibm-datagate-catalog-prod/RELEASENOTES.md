## Introduction

IBM Db2 for z/OS Data Gate (Db2 Data Gate) propagates your data from a Db2 for z/OS subsystem to a Db2 LUW database through an integrated, low latency, high throughput synchronization protocol. With Db2 Data Gate, your read-only applications can quickly access your Db2 for z/OS data without impacting the performance of the core transaction engine.

## Prerequisites
IBM DB2 AESE or IBM DB2 Warehouse is the Prerequisites for Data Gate since Data Gate needs one deployed DB2 AESE/Warehouse instance as the target database.
