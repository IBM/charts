DataGate is delivered as an interconnected set of pods and kubernetes services. It's a kind of base service of CP4D.

Note: It may take some time for Data Gate to initialize, please be patient.

Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface:
  kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running command:
  helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls

3. use "kubectl get pods" or "helm status {release name} --tls" to list all Pod names

4. Uninstall deployment
  cpd-linux uninstall --assembly datagate -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

  or uninstall it in manual.
4.1 find install operator pod
  oc get pod|grep cpd-install-operator
4.2 run helm delete in operator pod
  oc exec -it cpd-install-operator-<xxxx> bash
  helm list --tls
  helm delete --purge {{ .Chart.Name }} --tls
