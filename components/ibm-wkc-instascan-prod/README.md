# IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog InstaScan

Identify risk hot spots and assess compliance with regulatory requirements for cloud data sources

With IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog InstaScan, you can manage unstructured data in cloud data sources. Define policies for placement of sensitive data that reflect regulatory requirements or your organisationâ€™s directives. Connect to various cloud data sources and assign such policies to those data sources. Then, run risk assessments on the data sources to identify high risk areas. After you remediate the risks uncovered, assess compliance of your data sources with your policies for placement of sensitive data.
