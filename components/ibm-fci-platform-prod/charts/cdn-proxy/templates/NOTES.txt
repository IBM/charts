Update the NOTES file with appropriate detail about the chart.
This information will be displayed whent the chart is installed.
If this chart is a subchart for an unbrella chart, information from
this NOTES.txt file is often integrated into the parent NOTES.txt file
to provide a cohesive set of information on what the chart provides.

For example:
== Provided services ==
REST Services provided at:
https://{{ required "global.managerFQDN must be set to be able to reference the kubernetes manager node for port forwarding examples." .Values.global.managerFQDN }}:3000/common-ui/rest/

...

Update the PV initialization section with any PVs that need to be
initialized.  If the chart has no PVs, simply delete
the == PV initialization == section and continue editing the file.

Update the Common port forwarding section with any ports that should
be exposed *OUTSIDE* of the cluster.  These ports will be forwarded
from the kubernetes manager to the appropriate service destination.
If the chart has only internal services, delete
the == Common port forwarding == section and continue editing the file.

== PV initialization ==
./initialize-pv -p $(kubectl get pod -l app={{ template "common-ui.name" . }}-nginx,release={{ .Release.Name }} -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}') -i init-pv -t __DATA_FILE_ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY__/fci-common-ui-web-data.tar.gz
#== Common port forwarding ==
#forwards:
#  3000:
#    serviceReleaseName: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
#    serviceName: "common-ui-nodejs"
#    servicePort: "3000"
#  9443:
#    serviceReleaseName: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
#    serviceName: "common-ui-liberty"
#    servicePort: "9443"
#== END OF NOTES ==
