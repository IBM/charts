DataGate is delivered as an interconnected set of pods and kubernetes services.

Note: It may take some time for Data Gate to initialize, please be patient.

Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface:
  kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running helm tests:
  helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls

3. use "kubectl get pods |grep data-gate-" or "helm status {release name} --tls" to list all Pod names

4. Uninstall deployment:
  Please delete it by deleting instance of datagate on CP4D UI.
