IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (Z125-5543-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Studio Premium V3.0 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 60 days.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Bundled Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Bundled Programs:
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Enterprise Edition
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Gold
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Professional
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Premium
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio

Separately Licensed Code

The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to the extent they are held to be invalid or unenforceable under the law that governs this license. Each of the components listed below is considered "Separately Licensed Code". IBM Separately Licensed Code is licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program. Notwithstanding any of the terms in the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, the terms of such third party license agreement(s) governs Licensee's use of all Separately Licensed Code unless otherwise noted below.

Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in another NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee has read and agrees to the license agreements contained in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s). If Licensee does not agree to the terms of these third party license agreements, Licensee may not use the Separately Licensed Code.

For Programs acquired under the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") or International Program License Agreement for Non Warranted Program ("ILAN") and Licensee is the original licensee of the Program, if Licensee does not agree with the third party license agreements, Licensee may return the Program in accordance with the terms of, and within the specified time frames stated in, the "Money-back Guarantee" section of the IPLA or ILAN IBM Agreement.

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM:
(a) IBM provides this Separately Licensed Code to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND;
(b) IBM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE;
(c) IBM is not liable to Licensee, and will not defend, indemnify, or hold Licensee harmless for any claims arising from or related to the Separately Licensed Code; and
(d) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code.

Notwithstanding these exclusions, in Germany and Austria, IBM's warranty and liability for the Separately Licensed Code is governed only by the respective terms applicable for Germany and Austria in IBM license agreements.

Note: IBM may provide limited support for some Separately Licensed Code. If such support is available, the details and any additional terms related to such support will be set forth in the License Information document.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Third Party Operating Systems

For the convenience of Licensee, the Program may be accompanied by a third party operating system. The operating system is not part of the Program, and is licensed directly by the operating system provider (e.g., Red Hat Inc., Novell Inc., etc.) to Licensee. IBM is not a party to the license between Licensee and the third party operating system provider, and includes the third party operating system "AS IS", without representation or warranty, express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Bundled Program Details:

IBM Cloud Pak For Data Enterprise Edition
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC / 1 VPC

IBM SPSS Modeler Server Gold
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 70 PVU / 1 VPC

IBM SPSS Modeler Server Professional
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 70 PVU / 1 VPC

IBM SPSS Modeler Premium Server 
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 70 PVU / 1 VPC 

IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimize
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 70 PVU / 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

This Program includes the following software which may not be used for Evil purposes.

 json.jar



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (Z125-3301-14) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Studio Premium V3.0 (5737-K83)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Bundled Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Bundled Programs:
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Enterprise Edition
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Gold
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Professional
IBM SPSS Modeler Server Premium
IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio

Components Not Used for Establishing Required Entitlements

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program components are not taken into consideration. In other words, Licensee may install and use the following Program components, under the license terms, but these components are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.
User Management service (of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)

Repository service (of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)

Add-on Management service (of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)

Workload monitoring & Security management service (of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Third Party Operating Systems

For the convenience of Licensee, the Program may be accompanied by a third party operating system. The operating system is not part of the Program, and is licensed directly by the operating system provider (e.g., Red Hat Inc., Novell Inc., etc.) to Licensee. IBM is not a party to the license between Licensee and the third party operating system provider, and includes the third party operating system "AS IS", without representation or warranty, express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

For each physical Server, Licensee must have sufficient entitlements for the lesser of 1) the sum of all available Virtual Processor Cores on all Virtual Servers or 2) all available Processor Cores on the physical Server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).
