** It may take a few minutes for the service to become available. Please be patient. **

Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface:
  kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running helm tests:
  helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls --cleanup

(Note: If you haven't done so, you must run ./ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions/pre-install/clusterAdministration/labelNamespace.sh {{ include "gateway.addonService.zenNamespace" . }} in order for your service to be functional)
