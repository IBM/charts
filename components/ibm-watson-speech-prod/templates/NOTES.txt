Note: It may take some time for Watson Speech Services to initialize, please be patient.

The first part of deployment is uploading STT models into local object storage.

The second part is to start service and it may take some time because all models used 
by runtime has to be downloaded and initialize.

You can monitor the status of the pods with the following command:
  kubectl get -n services pods

Once all the pods are running, you can run the helm tests:
  helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls
