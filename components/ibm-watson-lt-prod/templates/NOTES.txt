After a successful installation, go to your CloudPak for Data UI and you will find the WLT add-on listed in the catalog.

Select the WLT add-on and provision a new service instance.
Once the instance is provisioned, you will be presented with connection details and credentials for your instance.

### Upgrade support to change the set of installed language pairs for translation

In version {{ .Chart.Version }} the Watson Language Translator CloudPak supports +70 language pairs (e.g. English to Spanish or German to English).

You need to explicitly enable the set of language pairs that you want to make available. This is done by setting the "enabled: true" parameter
for the desired language pairs in the installation configuration YAML file.

You can update the set of installed languages any time by running an upgrade of your installed chart.
Please refer to the product documentation on how to upgrade an existing chart on your platform.
