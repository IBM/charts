#
# Objective:
# - To be a blank template which is filled-in during deployment with secrets from vault (when in the cloud).
# - This template can be used for environments where there are no secrets.
# - Keep secrets separated from regular settings. They are handled differently in the cloud.
#
# Each environment should aim to fill-in as much/little of this template as they need.
# Obviously some values are not needed in some environments. eg: Local won't need cloudant.
