Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program includes components in source code form ("Source Components"), or other materials identified as Sample Materials or both. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement; provided, however, that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1) Prerequisite Programs

In addition to the entitlements required for the Program, Licensee must also obtain at least one entitlement to one of the following Named Programs:

Named Programs:

- IBM Cognos Analytics Explorer Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- IBM Cognos Analytics User Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- IBM Cognos Analytics Viewer Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- IBM Cognos Analytics Authorized Explorer Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data 
- IBM Cognos Analytics Authorized User Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data 
- IBM Cognos Analytics Authorized Viewer Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data 

2) Bursting Feature Requirement

Each person who is provided an output(s) of the Program through the Bursting feature or who authenticates to the Program must be covered by an appropriate entitlement.

3) Supporting Program Details

3A) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 1)
- Entitlement: No Metric
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

Additional Supporting Program Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.

3B) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 2)
- Entitlement: 0.02 Terabytes
- Use Limitations: Unrestricted

Terabyte is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. A Terabyte is 2 to the 40th power bytes.

Under the above Terabyte entitlement for DB2:

a) The Terabyte entitlements for this Supporting Program must be sufficient to cover the Terabytes of user data, as reported by DB2. The number of required entitlements must be calculated separately for each database.

b) Licensee may only use the Supporting Program for a data warehouse and run a data warehouse workload. A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant collection of data that integrates data from multiple data sources for historical ad hoc data reporting and querying. A data warehouse workload is a workload that typically scans thousands or millions of rows in a single query in order to support the analysis of data in a data warehouse.

c) All user data must reside in column-organized tables.

"Unrestricted" means that, notwithstanding the language in the Supporting Programs section of this License Information, Licensee's right to use the Supporting Program is not limited to use only in support of Licensee's use of the Principal Program. While the other restrictions on Licensee's use of the Supporting Program continue to apply, Licensee may use the Supporting Program for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program.

4) Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1) Prohibited Components

Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement, Licensee is not authorized to use any of the following components or functions of the Program:

- IBM Cognos Administration, except Data Source Connections
- Notebook (of IBM Cognos Analytics for Jupyter Notebook)
- Manage, except Data server connections
- pureScale clustering technology (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- SQL Replication (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- Q Replication (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- DB2 Connect (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- SQL Warehousing Tool (SQW) (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)

- IBM WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5 (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- IBM WebSphere MQ 8.0 (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)
- IBM Data Server Manager Enterprise Edition 2.1 (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)

2) Prerequisite Programs

In addition to the entitlements required for the Program, Licensee must also obtain at least one entitlement to IBM Cognos Analytics Administrator Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

3) Supporting Program Details

3A) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 1)
- Entitlement: No Metric
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

Additional Supporting Program Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.

3B) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 2)
- Entitlement: 0.02 Terabytes
- Use Limitations: Unrestricted

Terabyte is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. A Terabyte is 2 to the 40th power bytes.

Under the above Terabyte entitlement for DB2:

a) The Terabyte entitlements for this Supporting Program must be sufficient to cover the Terabytes of user data, as reported by DB2. The number of required entitlements must be calculated separately for each database.

b) Licensee may only use the Supporting Program for a data warehouse and run a data warehouse workload. A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant collection of data that integrates data from multiple data sources for historical ad hoc data reporting and querying. A data warehouse workload is a workload that typically scans thousands or millions of rows in a single query in order to support the analysis of data in a data warehouse.

c) All user data must reside in column-organized tables.

"Unrestricted" means that, notwithstanding the language in the Supporting Programs section of this License Information, Licensee's right to use the Supporting Program is not limited to use only in support of Licensee's use of the Principal Program. While the other restrictions on Licensee's use of the Supporting Program continue to apply, Licensee may use the Supporting Program for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program.

4) Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1) Prohibited Components

Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement, Licensee is not authorized to use any of the following components or functions of the Program:

- IBM Cognos Administration, except Data Source Connections
- Manage, except Data server connections
- IBM Cognos Software Development Kit
- pureScale clustering technology (of IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition)

3) Bursting Feature Requirement

Each person who is provided an output(s) of the Program through the Bursting feature or who authenticates to the Program must be covered by an appropriate entitlement.

4) Supporting Program Details

4A) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 1)
- Entitlement: No Metric
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

Additional Supporting Program Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.

4B) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 2)
- Entitlement: 0.02 Terabytes
- Use Limitations: Unrestricted

Terabyte is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. A Terabyte is 2 to the 40th power bytes.

Under the above Terabyte entitlement for DB2:

a) The Terabyte entitlements for this Supporting Program must be sufficient to cover the Terabytes of user data, as reported by DB2. The number of required entitlements must be calculated separately for each database.

b) Licensee may only use the Supporting Program for a data warehouse and run a data warehouse workload. A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant collection of data that integrates data from multiple data sources for historical ad hoc data reporting and querying. A data warehouse workload is a workload that typically scans thousands or millions of rows in a single query in order to support the analysis of data in a data warehouse.

c) All user data must reside in column-organized tables.

"Unrestricted" means that, notwithstanding the language in the Supporting Programs section of this License Information, Licensee's right to use the Supporting Program is not limited to use only in support of Licensee's use of the Principal Program. While the other restrictions on Licensee's use of the Supporting Program continue to apply, Licensee may use the Supporting Program for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program.

5) Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

1) Prerequisite Programs

In addition to the entitlements required for the Program, Licensee must also obtain at least one entitlement to IBM Cognos Analytics Administrator Extension for IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

2) Bursting Feature Requirement

Each person who is provided an output(s) of the Program through the Bursting feature or who authenticates to the Program must be covered by an appropriate entitlement.

3) Supporting Program Details

3A) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 1)
- Entitlement: No Metric
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

Additional Supporting Program Details

The Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory on each physical or virtual server; however, if the Supporting Program is used on a cluster of servers configured to work together using database partitioning or other permitted clustering technology, the Supporting Program may use a maximum of 16 processor cores and 128 GB of memory across all virtual or physical servers in that cluster.

3B) IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition (Entitlement 2)
- Entitlement: 0.02 Terabytes
- Use Limitations: Unrestricted

Terabyte is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. A Terabyte is 2 to the 40th power bytes.

Under the above Terabyte entitlement for DB2:

a) The Terabyte entitlements for this Supporting Program must be sufficient to cover the Terabytes of user data, as reported by DB2. The number of required entitlements must be calculated separately for each database.

b) Licensee may only use the Supporting Program for a data warehouse and run a data warehouse workload. A data warehouse is a subject-oriented, integrated, time-variant collection of data that integrates data from multiple data sources for historical ad hoc data reporting and querying. A data warehouse workload is a workload that typically scans thousands or millions of rows in a single query in order to support the analysis of data in a data warehouse.

c) All user data must reside in column-organized tables.

"Unrestricted" means that, notwithstanding the language in the Supporting Programs section of this License Information, Licensee's right to use the Supporting Program is not limited to use only in support of Licensee's use of the Principal Program. While the other restrictions on Licensee's use of the Supporting Program continue to apply, Licensee may use the Supporting Program for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program.

4) Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least one instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic units. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlements for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information. 

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.
