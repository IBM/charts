#    filenames: [] # a list of filenames to match on, must be a superset
#                  # of the filenames listed in the message to match. If

#                  # omit the line number in the override.
#    message: ""   # a regular expression matching the whole message as
#                  # it appears in the console output.
#    severity: ""  # the severity name to ignore, "INFO", "ERROR", etc.
#    reduceTo: ""  # the severity to map to a matching message. If
#                  # undefined, corresponds to ignore.
