NOTICE

This document includes License Information documents below for multiple Programs. Each License Information document identifies the Program(s) to which it applies. Only those License Information documents for the Program(s) for which Licensee has acquired entitlements apply.


==============================================


IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (Z125-5543-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Cognos Analytics Bundle 11.1.5 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 60 days.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Bundled Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Export and Import Restrictions

This Program may contain cryptography. Transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. restrictions on exports or reexports. To obtain the export classification of this Program refer to: https://www.ibm.com/products/exporting/.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Red Hat Products

Red Hat Products (as listed below) are licensed separately and are supported by IBM only when used in support of the Program and only while Licensee has Software Subscription and Support in effect for the Program. In addition, Licensee agrees that its use of and support for the Red Hat Products are subject to the following terms (https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements).

Red Hat Product:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- Additional Entitlement Ratio: 1 VPC/ 1 VPC

"Additional Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the identified program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program as a whole. The specified ratio does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. The number of entitlements for the identified program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for an identified program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the identified program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the identified program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to other components of the Program, as well).

Conversion Entitlement Details

These Conversion Entitlement Details outline the entitlement conversion options. Licensee is entitled to the below entitlement conversion options in any deployment combination of Licensee's choosing and may choose to convert entitlements between the listed programs below at any time provided that the sum of Licensee's deployments do not exceed the total amount of Licensee's entitlements obtained for the Program. Licensee is not entitled to use entitlements obtained of the Program for any other purpose.

IBM Cloud Pak for Data Cognos Analytics Explorer
- Conversion Entitlement Ratio: 70 PVU/1 VPC

"Conversion Entitlement Ratio n/m" means that Licensee can convert some number ('n') entitlements of the indicated metric for the listed program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the specified metric for the Program. Once converted, Licensee may only use such converted entitlements for the listed program. The specified conversion does not apply to any entitlements for the Program that are not of the required metric type. For example, if the conversion is 100 entitlements of a listed program for every 500 entitlements obtained of the Program and Licensee acquires 1,500 entitlements of the Program, Licensee may convert those 1,500 entitlements into 300 entitlements of the listed program, allowing the Licensee to use the listed program up to the 300 entitlements.

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the PVU Table by Processor Vendor, Brand, Type and Model Number at (http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Supporting Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

The Licensee can deploy the Supporting Program using either Full Capacity licensing or Virtualization Capacity (Sub-Capacity) licensing according to the Passport Advantage Sub-Capacity Licensing Terms (see webpage below). If using Full Capacity licensing, the Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores* in the physical hardware environment made available to or managed by the Supporting Program, except for those servers from which the Supporting Program has been permanently removed. If using Virtualization Capacity licensing, the Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores made available to or managed by the Supporting Program, as defined according to the Virtualization Capacity License Counting Rules at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/Counting_Software_licenses_using_specific_virtualization_technologies.html.

* An Activated processor core is a processor core that is available for use in a physical or virtual server, regardless of whether the capacity of the processor core can be or is limited through virtualization technologies, operating system commands, BIOS settings, or similar restrictions.

Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server.
