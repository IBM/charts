​
## Introduction

[IBM Watson™ AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-aiops) combines structured and unstructured data from applications and infrastructure components of your IT landscape. It applies AI to that data to discover anomalies and correlate them to discover impact across components and to localize faults This is used to  guide IT operations teams to understand the nature and impact of issues as they emerge and to guide inform short term remedies and permanent resolutions.

​
## Prerequisites
[IBM Watson™ AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-aiops) requires the following resources before installing:
​
- IBM® Cloud Pak for Data version 3.0.1
- Red Hat® OpenShift® version 4.3
- Portworx
- Strimzi
- S3FS (Post Install)


This is documented in more detail in the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/svc-aiops/aiops-prereqs.html).


## Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements
​
This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster-scoped as well as namespace-scoped pre- and post-actions that need to be taken.
​
The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`restricted`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc), has been verified for this chart with one exception. S3FS requires adding `flexVolume` to the `volumes` section. This is detailed in the following custom SecurityContextConstraints which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart.
​
  - From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom SecurityContextConstraints
    - Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:
      ```
      apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
      kind: SecurityContextConstraints
      metadata:

      seLinuxContext:
        type: MustRunAs
      supplementalGroups:
        type: RunAsAny
      users:
      - system:serviceaccount:zeno
      volumes:
      - configMap
      - downwardAPI
      - emptyDir
      - hostPath
      - persistentVolumeClaim
      - projected
      - secret
      - flexVolume
      ```
​
## Resources Required
​
The resources required depend on the size of the training datasets as well as the operational data volumes expected during runtime that get used in applying our AI models.  

This is documented in more detail in the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/svc-aiops/aiops-prereqs.html).
​
## Installing the Chart

[IBM Watson™ AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-aiops) is intended to be installed using the CloudPak for Data Command Line Interface (CLI).  This will configure and install this helm chart.  It is not intended to be run standalone.

This is documented in more detail in the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/svc-aiops/aiops-install.html).
​
​
### Uninstalling the Chart

​[IBM Watson™ AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-aiops) can be uninstalled using the CloudPak for Data Command Line Interface (CLI).  This will uninstall the previously deployed helm chart and any associated resources.  It is not intended to be run standalone.

This is documented in more detail in the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/producthub/icpdata/docs/content/SSQNUZ_current/svc-aiops/aiops-uninstall.html).
​


## Configuration
​[IBM Watson™ AIOps](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-aiops) is configured using the CloudPak for Data UI.
