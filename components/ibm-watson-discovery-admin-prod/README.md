# IBM Watson Discovery

## Introduction
IBM Watson™ Discovery for IBM® Cloud Pak is an AI-powered search and content analytics engine that finds answers and insights from complex business content with speed and accuracy. Answers can be surfaced to users through a conversational dialog driven by Watson Assistant or embedded in your own user-interface. With its Smart Document Understanding training interface, Watson Discovery can learn where answers live in complex business content based on a visual understanding of documents. Further enhance Watson Discovery's ability to understand domain specific language by teaching it with Watson Knowledge Studio.

Watson Discovery brings together a functionally rich set of integrated and automated Watson APIs to:
  - Convert, enrich, and normalize data.
  - Securely explore your proprietary content as well as free and licensed public content.
  - Apply additional enrichments such as keywords through Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
  - Simplify development while still providing direct access to APIs.
