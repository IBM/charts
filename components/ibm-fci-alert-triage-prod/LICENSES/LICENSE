IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Resource Value Unit (RVU)

Resource Value Unit (RVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. RVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number of units of a specific resource used or managed by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment for the specific resources as specified in the table below. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

The Resource for the purpose of RVU calculation is an Alert. An Alert is information identified as an alert by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to cover the highest number of Alerts processed monthly by the Program in any consecutive twelve (12) months.

Resource Value Unit Conversion Table

From 1 to 100 Resources, 1.0 RVU per Resource
From 101 to 250 Resources, 100 RVUs plus 0.9 RVUs per Resource above 100
From 251 to 500 Resources, 235 RVUs plus 0.8 RVUs per Resource above 250
From 501 to 750 Resources, 435 RVUs plus 0.6 RVUs per Resource above 500
From 751 to 1,250 Resources, 585 RVUs plus 0.5 RVUs per Resource above 750
From 1,251 to 2,000 Resources, 835 RVUs plus 0.4 RVUs per Resource above 1,250
For more than 2,000 Resources, 1,135 RVUs plus 0.3 RVUs per Resource above 2,000
