Update the NOTES file with appropriate detail about the chart.
This information will be displayed whent the chart is installed.
If this chart is a subchart for an unbrella chart, information from
this NOTES.txt file is often integrated into the parent NOTES.txt file
to provide a cohesive set of information on what the chart provides.

For example:
== Provided services ==
REST Services provided at:
https://{{ .Values.global.managerFQDN }}:3000/fci-insurance/rest/

UI provided at:
https://{{ .Values.global.managerFQDN }}:9449/console

...

Update the PV initialization section with any PVs that need to be
initialized.  If the chart has no PVs, simply delete
the == PV initialization == section and continue editing the file.

Update the Common port forwarding section with any ports that should
be exposed *OUTSIDE* of the cluster.  These ports will be forwarded
from the kubernetes manager to the appropriate service destination.
If the chart has only internal services, delete
the == Common port forwarding == section and continue editing the file.

== Common port forwarding ==
forwards:
  9449:
    serviceNamespace: "{{ .Release.Namespace }}"
    serviceReleaseName: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
    serviceName: "fci-insurance-liberty"
    servicePort: "9443"
== END OF NOTES ==
