  # hostAliases provides a way to manage /etc/hosts in all Kubernetes 
  # pods that will be installed in the Kubernetes cluster.  
  # This is useful in situations where DNS may not work properly,
  # or DNS entries are not used at all.  Most often, this is used
  # to add the Hadoop (HDP) servers into the /etc/hosts of each pod to
  # ensure that pods can resolve the HDP servers to the correct IP
  # addresses.

  # In addition if you are using this because of DNS issues
  # you most likely would need to create /etc/hosts entries on the
  # nodes (hosts) that are running Kubernetes (the Kubernetes Master
  # and Kubernetes Worker nodes) to contain the hostnames and ip 
  # addresses of the Hadoop servers (nodes). 
  #
  # Below are examples with hostnames of hdp1, hdp2, hdp3
  # and the dns of the servers end in .yourcompany.com
  # If you have 6 HDP servers then follow the pattern below 
  # and enter ip and hostnames for 6 servers
  # 
  # Also uncomment all the lines below for this to take affect
  #
  # hostAliases:
  # - ip: "10.187.45.4"
  #   hostnames:
  #   - "hdp1.yourcompany.com"
  # - ip: "10.187.45.38"
