# Hazelcast Enterprise

[Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise](https://hazelcast.com/products/enterprise/) is the most widely used in-memory data grid with hundreds of thousands of installed clusters around the world. It offers caching solutions ensuring that data is in the right place when itâ€™s needed for optimal performance.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic hz-enterprise-license-key --from-literal=key=LICENSE-KEY
$ helm install community/hazelcast-enterprise
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Hazelcast Enterprise](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/tree/master/hazelcast-enterprise-kubernetes) and [Management Center](https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center-docker) deployments on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.9+
- [Container Image Security](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.0/manage_images/image_security.html) is enabled by default in IBM Cloud Private 3.1+. Therefore, Docker Hub container registry `docker.io/hazelcast/*` must be added to the list of trusted registries.

An example cluster image policy as below :

```
apiVersion: securityenforcement.admission.cloud.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImagePolicy
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-default-cluster-image-policy
spec:
  repositories:
  - name: docker.io/hazelcast/*
```

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement, there may be cluster-scoped as well as namespace-scoped actions that you must do before and after installation.

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name ibm-restricted-psp has been verified for this chart. If your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy, you can proceed to install the chart.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart, you need to first create a secret with the Hazelcast Enterprise License Key:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic hz-enterprise-license-key --from-literal=key=LICENSE-KEY
```

Then, to install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release community/hazelcast-enterprise
```

The command deploys Hazelcast on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the Hazelcast chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release \
  --set cluster.memberCount=3,hazelcast.rest=false \
    community/hazelcast-enterprise
```

The above command sets number of Hazelcast members to 3 and disables REST endpoints.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml community/hazelcast-enterprise
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) with the `hazelcast.license` filled in

## Custom Hazelcast configuration

Custom Hazelcast configuration can be specified inside `values.yaml`, as the `hazelcast.configurationFiles.hazelcastXml` property.

```yaml
hazelcast:
  configurationFiles:
    hazelcastXml: |-
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <hazelcast xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config hazelcast-config-3.10.xsd"
                     xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/config"
                     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    
        <properties>
          <property name="hazelcast.discovery.enabled">true</property>
        </properties>
        <network>
          <join>
            <multicast enabled="false"/>
            <tcp-ip enabled="false" />
            <discovery-strategies>
              <discovery-strategy enabled="true" class="com.hazelcast.kubernetes.HazelcastKubernetesDiscoveryStrategy">
              </discovery-strategy>
            </discovery-strategies>
          </join>
        </network>

        <management-center enabled="${hazelcast.mancenter.enabled}">${hazelcast.mancenter.url}</management-center>

        <!-- Custom Configuration Placeholder -->
      </hazelcast>
```
