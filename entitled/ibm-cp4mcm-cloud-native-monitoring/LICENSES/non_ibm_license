To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither Red Hat nor any RedHat authorized distributor will be liable to you for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Ansible Tower Software or any component, even if Red Hat or the authorized distributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Red Hat's liability or an authorized distributor's liability exceed the amount that you paid to Red Hat for the Ansible Tower Software during the twelve months preceding the first event giving rise to liability.

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained

GNU Free Documentation License

Version 1.1, March 2000

Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth

Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this

license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written

document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective

freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either

commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for

the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not

being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works

of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It

complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license

designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free

software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program

should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software

does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be

used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is

published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for

works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice

placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the

terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual

or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the

Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with

modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of

the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the

publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject

(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly

within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part

a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any

mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection

with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,

philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles

are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice

that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as

Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the

Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,

represented in a format whose specification is available to the

general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and

straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of

pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available

drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for

automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to

text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format

whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent

modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not

"Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII

without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML

using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML

designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,

proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word

processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not

generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word

processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus

such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this

License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which

do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the

most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning

of the body of the text.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either

commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the

copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to

the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other

conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use

technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying

of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept

compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough

number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and

you may publicly display copies.

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,

and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose

the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover

Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the

back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as

the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full

title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may

add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes

limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the

Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim

copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are

too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed

(as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest

onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering

more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent

copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy

a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete

Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the

general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no

charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter

option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin

distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this

Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location

until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque

copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to

the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the

Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give

them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the

conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the

Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version

filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and

modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.

In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct

from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which

should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the

Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the

original publisher of that version gives permission.

B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities

responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,

together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document

(all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified

Version, as the publisher.

D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent

to the other copyright notices.

F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice

giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the

terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections

and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it

an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of

the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section

entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,

authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then

add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous

sentence.

J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for

public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the

network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was

based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit

a network location for a work that was published at least four years

before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version

it refers to gives permission.

K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve

the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and

tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications

given therein.

L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in

their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are

not considered part of the section titles.

M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not

be included in the Modified Version.

N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to

conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices

that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from

the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these

sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of

Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These

titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains

nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various

parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has

been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a

standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a

passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list

of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover

Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through

arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes

a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by

arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may

not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission

from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License

give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or

imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this

License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified

versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the

Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and

list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its

license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and

multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single

copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but

different contents, make the title of each such section unique by

adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original

author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.

Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of

Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"

in the various original documents, forming one section entitled

"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",

and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections

entitled "Endorsements."

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents

released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this

License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in

the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for

verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute

it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this

License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other

respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and

independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or

distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of

the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the

compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this

License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled

with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are

not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies

of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the

entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that

surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must

appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute

translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing

Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from

their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all

Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these

Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License

provided that you also include the original English version of this

License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the

original English version of this License, the original English version

will prevail.

9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except

as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy,

modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties

who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will

not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full

compliance.

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU

Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to

address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this

License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of

following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or

of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the

Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version

number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not

as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of

the License in the document and put the following copyright and license

notices just after the title page:

Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy, distribute

and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free

Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version published by the

Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR

TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover

Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the section

entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"

instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover

Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being

LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we

recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free

software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their

use in free software.

Server Side Public License version 1

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained under the

Server Side Public License version 1:

MONGODB

Server Side Public License

VERSION 1, OCTOBER 16, 2018

Copyright (C) 2018 MongoDB, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this

license document, but changing it is not allowed.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to Server Side Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of

works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this

License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and

"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in

a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an

exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the

earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on

the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without

permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for

infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a

computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,

distribution (with or without modification), making available to the

public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other

parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a

computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the

extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that

(1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that

there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties

are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and

how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of

user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list

meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for

making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a

work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official

standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of

interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is

widely used among developers working in that language. The "System

Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as

a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves

only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement

a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the

public in source code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a

major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the

specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or

a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used

to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the

source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run

the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control

those activities. However, it does not include the work's System

Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs

which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are

not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes

interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and

the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms

that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate

data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can

regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of

copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated

conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited

permission to run the unmodified Program, subject to section 13. The

output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the

output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law. Subject to section 13, you may make, run and propagate

covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your

license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to

others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively

for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided

that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all

material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or

running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your

behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them

from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their

relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the

conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it

unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological

measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11

of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws

prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid

circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is

effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the

covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or

modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users,

your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of

technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you

receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep

intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms

added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices

of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this

License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for

each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty

protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to

produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms

of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,

and giving a relevant date.

b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released

under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This

requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all

notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to

anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore

apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the

whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are

packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any

other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have

separately received it.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display

Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive

interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work

need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent

works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and

which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on

a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if

the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the

access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the

individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does

not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of

sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable

Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these

ways:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product

(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the

Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily

used for software interchange.

b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product

(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written

offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you

offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give

anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the

Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is

covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used

for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost

of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to

copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the

written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is

allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received

the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place

(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the

Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no

further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the

Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy

the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on

a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports

equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions

next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.

Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain

obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to

satisfy these requirements.

e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of

the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under

subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded

from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included

in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any

tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,

or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation

into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,

doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular

product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a

typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status

of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user

actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product

is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent

the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,

procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install

and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from

a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must

suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object

code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because

modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or

specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part

of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User

Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term

(regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding

Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the

Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither

you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in

ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates

for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for

the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access

to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially

and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the

rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in

accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented

(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),

and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or

copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this

License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.

Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be

treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that

they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only

to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those

permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License

without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of

a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions

from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be

written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the

work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to

a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add

to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of

that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the

terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or

author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal

Notices displayed by works containing it; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or

requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in

reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or

authors of the material; or

e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade

names, trademarks, or service marks; or

f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material

by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with

contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any

liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those

licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further

restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you

received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is

governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,

you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further

restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you

may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license

document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such

relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must

place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms

that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the

applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be

stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as

exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly

provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify

it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this

License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph

of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license

from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,

unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates

your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to

notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days

after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of

violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and

you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the

licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under

this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently

reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same

material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a

copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring

solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a

copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than

this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered

work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.

Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your

acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives

a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that

work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing

compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an

organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an

organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work

results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who

receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work

the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous

paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the

work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can

get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights

granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a

license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted

under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a

cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim

is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing

the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this

License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work

thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter

acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this

License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not

include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further

modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,

"control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner

consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free

patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,

use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate

the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express

agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent

(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to

sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a party

means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent

against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and

the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,

free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly

available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must

either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)

arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this

particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the

requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream

recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge that, but

for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or

your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason

to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or

arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a

covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving

the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a

specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is

automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works

based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the

scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on

the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically

granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are

a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of

distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party

based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under

which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the

covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection

with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific

products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you

entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior

to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any

implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be

available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot use,

propagate or convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then

as a consequence you may not use, propagate or convey it at all. For

example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for

further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way

you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain

entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Offering the Program as a Service.

If you make the functionality of the Program or a modified version

available to third parties as a service, you must make the Service Source

Code available via network download to everyone at no charge, under the

terms of this License. Making the functionality of the Program or

modified version available to third parties as a service includes,

without limitation, enabling third parties to interact with the

functionality of the Program or modified version remotely through a

computer network, offering a service the value of which entirely or

primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or

offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the

Program or modified version.

"Service Source Code" means the Corresponding Source for the Program or

the modified version, and the Corresponding Source for all programs that

you use to make the Program or modified version available as a service,

including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces,

application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software,

backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a

user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code

you make available.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

MongoDB, Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Server Side

Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

specifies that a certain numbered version of the Server Side Public

License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of

following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of

any later version published by MongoDB, Inc. If the Program does not

specify a version number of the Server Side Public License, you may

choose any version ever published by MongoDB, Inc.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of

the Server Side Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement

of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that

version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.

However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright

holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM

IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS

THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING

ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF

THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU

OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above

cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing

courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute

waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a

warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in

return for a fee.

SIL Open Font License 1.1

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and

open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership

with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The

fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,

redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved

names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,

however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The

requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply

to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the

copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as

distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the

Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

THE LATEX PROJECT PUBLIC LICENSE

The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM obtained

under the LATEX PROJECT PUBLIC LICENSE:

latex [fonts-tlwg],

hyphenation-afrikans

LPPL Version 1.3c 2008-05-04

Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project

Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this

license document, but modification of it is not allowed.

PREAMBLE

========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under

which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright

and which you wish to distribute. This license may be particularly

suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but

it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is

unrelated to TeX.

The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',

below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors

who are considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed

and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of

that work may be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you

the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work

that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while

maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of

that work. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while

meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'

and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.

DEFINITIONS

===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

`Work'

Any work being distributed under this License.

`Derived Work'

Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

`Modification'

Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable

law -- for example, the production of a file containing an

original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of

such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

translated into another language.

`Modify'

To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any

applicable law.

`Distribution'

Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in

whole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to)

making any electronic components of the Work accessible by

file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file

systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).

`Compiled Work'

A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it

is directly usable on a computer system. This processing may

include using installation facilities provided by the Work,

transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or

other activities. Note that modification of any installation

facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.

`Current Maintainer'

A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is

no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under

any applicable law.

`Base Interpreter'

A program or process that is normally needed for running or

interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.

A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these

are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each

external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used

interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the

license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a

`LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the

`LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.

CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

===========================================

1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work

are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In

particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no

requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.

2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you

received it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered

modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived

Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.

3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a

complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2

above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that

the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly

as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work

directly from the Work.

4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without

restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may

also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including

Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works

distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to

be updated versions of the Work.

5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify

your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,

and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on

the Derived Work.

6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may

distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met

for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states

in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only

the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption

to a component of the Work.

a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement

for a component of the Work when that component is used with the

Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work

identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that

Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work

clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version

of this component to the user when used interactively with that

Base Interpreter.

b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices

detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a

prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part

of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log

of the changes.

c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,

including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version

of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)

the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the

Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that

they do provide such support for the Derived Work.

d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:

1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;

if your distribution of a modified component is made by

offering access to copy the modified component from a

designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy

the Work from the same or some similar place meets this

condition, even though third parties are not compelled to

copy the Work along with the modified component;

2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,

unmodified copy of the Work.

7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may

distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as

the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled

Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with

regard to the Derived Work.

8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not

apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it

becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as

it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative

format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is

then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or

nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of

applying that process.

10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license

provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in

Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have

to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.

b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that

Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of

itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the

restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.

11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to

the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating

such works with the Work by any means.

12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent

complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.

NO WARRANTY

===========

There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in

writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without

warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not

limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a

particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance

of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective, you assume

the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing

will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the

Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as

permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,

special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of

the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited

to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by

anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other

programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other

party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
