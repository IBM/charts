  # Object Server Configuration
  netcool:
    # The connection mode to use when connecting to the Netcool/OMNIbus Object Server.
    # Available options for connectionMode:
    # "Default"     - No authentication and no SSL enabled. This is the default.
    # "AuthOnly"    - Authentication enabled only. Object server must be run in secured mode. A secret 
    #                 containing "AuthUserName", "AuthPassword" and "encryption.keyfile" is required.
    # "SSLOnly"     - SSL enabled connection only. Object server must be configured with SSL certificates (AES_FIPS)
    #                 and a secret containing the "omni.kdb" and "omni.sth" is required.
    # "SSLAndAuth"  - SSL and Authentication are enabled. Object server must be run in secured mode and
    #                 SSL certificates configured (AES_FIPS). A secret containing "omni.kdb", "omni.sth", "encryption.keyfile",
    #                 "AuthUserName" and "AuthPassword" required.
    # Note: These connection modes are supported when connecting to your on-premise Object Server.
    #       For Netcool Operations Insight on ICP, you may enable IPSec to secure cluster network communications.

    # requires the probe process to have a fixed UID and GID value, this parameter must be set to true. Examples of these policies is the 
    # `ibm-restricted-psp` and `ibm-restricted-scc`.
    # Otherwise, if the helm chart is deployed in an environment enforced by an SCC that requires the probe process to support arbitrary UIDs, 
    # this parameter must be set to false. An example of this policy is the OpenShift `restricted` SCC.
