You can access IBM PowerAI Enterprise cluster now by the following steps:
{{- end }}
{{- if eq .Values.cluster.proxyOption "IngressProxy" }}
1. Configure your client DNS server to resolve "{{ template "master-fullname" . }}" to any public IP of the Kubernetes cluster. You can configure the host mapping in the client host /etc/hosts for a UNIX OS or /etc/hosts counterpart for Windows OS. For instance, replacing the "x.x.x.x" with any public ip of the Kubernetes cluster.
$ cat /etc/hosts
x.x.x.x {{ template "master-fullname" . }}

2. Access the cluster by browser with url "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:{{ template "guiPort" . }}/platform"

3. If you are using the default self-signed certificate, refer to steps 3 and onward in Locating the cluster management console "https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZU2E_2.3.0/get_started/locating_pmc.html".

1. Set up a network proxy at client browser. For instance, from a Firefox browser where you want to access a cluster management console, open "Preferences -> Advanced -> Network -> Connection Settings", fill up "Manual proxy configuration" with any public IP of the Kubernetes cluster, and port is 30123. Check up "User this proxy server for all protocols".

2. Access the cluster by browser with url "https://{{ template "master-fullname" . }}:8443/platform"

3. If you are using the default self-signed certificate, refer to steps 3 and onward in Locating the cluster management console "https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSZU2E_2.3.0/get_started/locating_pmc.html".
