# Default values for powerai-vision.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.

## The release tag for all container images. This should align
## with the release of PowerAI Vision that you are deploying
image:
  releaseTag: master
  repoPrefix:
  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent

## If your system supports dynamic provisioning of persistent values, set
## this to true.  Otherwise leave as false, and create your volumes manually.
persistence:
  useDynamicProvisioning: false

## A persistent volume is needed for PowerAI Vision.  We use a persistent
## volume claim.  You can manually create a persistent volume (using the label
## 'assign-to: NAME'), or let the system dynamically generate one (if your storage
## class supports it).

## The volume contains the data for models, images, etc.  The size of this
## is dependent on your dataset and model sizes.  Likely in the 40+ GB range.
poweraiVisionDataPvc:
  name: "{{ template \"shortname\" . }}-data-pvc"
  persistence:
    ## Requires persistence be enabled
    # enabled: true
    ## Specify the name of the Existing Claim to be used by your application
    existingClaimName:

    ## To use an existing StorageClass, set useDynamicProvisioning: true
    ## Specify the name of the StorageClass
    ## Setting StorageClass: "" will use whatever storageClass is currently
    ## setup as the Default
    storageClassName:

    ## Requires a Persistence Storage volume size minimum of 2Gi
    ## This is where all your images, videos etc. upload to, so don't skimp.
    size: "40Gi"

ingress:
  ## Very advanced users only...
  ## Don't disable - we don't expose any ports
  enabled: true
  ## Hostnames to bind the ingress to - use all hosts by default
  hosts:
  ## Empty string enables all proxy servers as hosts
  - ""
  tls:
    ## This lets you leverage your own certificate. See
    ## https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/ingress/controllers/nginx/examples/tls
    ## Secrets must be manually created in the namespace.

# This should stay false here as only one daemonset for any plugin should run
# in a cluster. When standalone goes to k8s 1.10 or higher, powerai_vision_start.sh
# will override this to true so the main instance will start the daemonset and
# alternate instances won't. ICP currently supports this as an optional setting.
