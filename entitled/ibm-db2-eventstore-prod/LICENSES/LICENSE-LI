IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (Z125-5543-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Db2 Event Store Enterprise Edition 2.0 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 60 days.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Third Party Operating Systems

For the convenience of Licensee, the Program may be accompanied by a third party operating system. The operating system is not part of the Program, and is licensed directly by the operating system provider (e.g., Red Hat Inc., Novell Inc., etc.) to Licensee. IBM is not a party to the license between Licensee and the third party operating system provider, and includes the third party operating system "AS IS", without representation or warranty, express or implied, including any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Supporting Program Details

IBM Data Science Experience Local Enterprise Edition
- Entitlement: 5 Authorized User 

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Supporting Program. The Supporting Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Supporting Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User accessing the Supporting Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person. 

High Availability/Failover Configurations:

The following describes Licensee's license entitlement requirements for secondary or standby servers used for high availability/failover configurations in support of primary servers on which the Program is installed. The following entitlement requirements are cumulative and are in addition to the entitlements required for the primary servers.

Hot Standby
"Hot Standby" means that the Program is operational on the secondary/standby server(s) to service user transactions or queries. All Hot Standby servers must be fully licensed under the same charge metric as the primary servers.

Idle/Warm Standby
"Idle/Warm Standby" means that the Program is installed but is not operational to service user transactions or query workloads, and is used exclusively for administrative actions that assist in failover scenarios, making a flash copy of a Event Store database and performing a database backup of this copy on another server. Idle/Warm Standby servers must be licensed as follows:
- On the secondary/standby server(s) the Program must be licensed for 1 Virtual Processor Core per virtual server or per un-partitioned physical server.

Cold Standby
"Cold Standby" means that the Program is installed but the Db2 Event Store data server is not running. A server is considered a Cold Standby server if Licensee must start the Db2 Event Store Container to instantiate the Event Store data server. No additional license entitlements are required for Cold Standby servers.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (Z125-3301-14) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Db2 Event Store Enterprise Edition 2.0 (5737-E53)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

For each physical Server, Licensee must have sufficient entitlements for the lesser of 1) the sum of all available Virtual Processor Cores on all Virtual Servers or 2) all available Processor Cores on the physical Server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.
