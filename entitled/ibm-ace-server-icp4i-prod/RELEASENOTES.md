# Breaking Changes (Prior to 2.1.0)

* Version 2.1.0 of this chart replaced the 'Local default Queue Manager' checkbox (used in versions 1.0.0-2.0.0) with a 'Which type of image to run' dropown list. That's because the chart now comes with an additional Docker image, the 'App Connect Enterprise with MQ client' image. Users of releases 2.0.0 and earlier of this chart can reuse existing values when upgrading to 2.2.0, but must ensure that the new option has the correct value to maintain your image selection, where 'App Connect Enterprise with MQ server' is the equivalent of selecting 'Local default Queue Manager'.

* Version 2.1.0 of this chart changed the way we specify images. In versions 1.0.0 through to 2.0.0 we used a common tag across all images. In version 2.1.0 we moved to including the tag with the name of the image. If you have customised the image name you will need to make sure that when upgrading you include the image tag on the appropriate image value.

* There are no breaking changes when upgrading from version 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
