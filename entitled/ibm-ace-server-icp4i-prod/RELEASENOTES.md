# Breaking Changes (migrating from versions prior to 3.0.0)

* Version 3.0.0 of this chart introduced Routes to support handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic on OpenShift 4.2. This has resulted in the removal of the "Proxy Node IP or FQDN" for specifying the proxy address used to access the endpoints of deployed integrations. Instead a Route is created which generates a hostname.
* Custom ports can no longer be specified via the Helm UI and must be configured by customising the charts
* Version 3.0.0 of this chart introduced the string `designerFlowsOperationMode` to replace the boolean `designerFlowsEnabled` from Versions 2.x of this chart in order to introduce more options for deployment of App Connect Designer flows. Users of Versions 2.x who had `designerFlowsEnabled` set to true can reuse existing values when upgrading to 3.1.0, but must select one of the two new options to continue deploying the additional sidecars for Designer flows.

# Whatâ€™s new in IBM App Connect Enterprise certified container Version 3.1.0

In this version of IBM App Connect Enterprise certified container, the following new features are available:

* New interface for creating integration servers without leaving the dashboard. Simplifies the user experience, so fewer steps are required and advanced configuration is hidden until necessary.
* You can now delete an integration server from within the dashboard interface.
* Ability to update a BAR file, including when used in Deployments and StatefulSets.

# Fixes

# Prerequisites
