# ODM for production Helm chart (ibm-odm-prod)

The [IBMÂ® Operational Decision Manager](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/operational-decision-management) (ODM) chart `ibm-odm-prod` is used to deploy a production-ready cluster in IBM Kubernetes environments.


## Introduction

ODM is a tool for capturing, automating, and governing repeatable business decisions. You identify situations about your business and then automate the actions to take as a result of the insight you gained about your policies and customers. For more information, see [ODM in knowledge center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/welcome/kc_welcome_odmV.html).

## Chart Details

The `ibm-odm-prod` Helm chart is a package of preconfigured Kubernetes resources that bootstrap an ODM deployment on a Kubernetes cluster. Configuration parameters are available to customize most aspects of the deployment. The default values serve as examples but are appropriate to a production environment and can be used as is.

The `ibm-odm-prod` chart deploys five containers corresponding to the five ODM services:
- Decision Center Business Console
- Decision Center Enterprise Console
- Decision Server Console
- Decision Server Runtime
- Decision Server Runner

The `ibm-odm-prod` chart supports the following options for persistence:

- PostgreSQL as an internal database. This is the **default** option. Persistent Volume (PV) is required if you choose to use an internal database. PV represents an underlying storage capacity in the infrastructure. PV must be created with accessMode ReadWriteOnce and storage capacity of 5Gi or more, before you install ODM. You create a PV in the Admin console or with a .yaml file.
- PostgreSQL or Db2 as an external database. If you specify a server name for the external database, the external database is used otherwise the internal database is used. Before you select this option, you must have an external PostgreSQL or Db2 database up and running.

## Architecture

The following architectures are supported:
- amd64  
- ppc64le
- s390x

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.11+ with Beta APIs enabled
- Helm 2.9.1 and later version
- One PersistentVolume needs to be created prior to installing the chart if internalDatabase.persistence.enabled=true and internalDatabase.persistence.dynamicProvisioning=false

Ensure you have a good understanding  of the underlying concepts and technologies:
- Helm chart, Docker, container
- Kubernetes
- Helm commands
- Kubernetes command line tool

Before you install ODM for production, you need to gather all the configuration information that you will use for your release. For more details, refer to the [ODM for production configuration parameters](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/ref_parameters_prod.html).

If you want to provide customized user access, read [Configuring user access](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/tsk_config_user_access.html)

If you want to use a custom security certificate, read [Defining the security certificate](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/tsk_replace_security_certificate.html)

 If you want to create your own decision services from scratch, you need to install Rule Designer from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/ibm-operational-decision-manager-developers-v-8102-rule-designer).

### Database Credentials Secret

 To preserve sensitive data, you must create a secret that encapsulates the database user and password before you install the Helm release. For details, see the **Before you begin** section in [Installing a Helm release of ODM for production](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/tsk_config_odm_icp_prod.html).

 Specify the name of the secret as the value for the parameters `internalDatabase.secretCredentials` or `externalDatabase.secretCredentials`, depending on the type of database you use.

## PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement, a specific cluster and namespace might have to be scoped.
The predefined PodSecurityPolicy name [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/psp/README.md) has been verifed for this chart. If your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy, you can proceed to install the chart.
However, if you use an internal database (internalDatabase.persistence.enabled=true), the previous PodSecurityPolicy is too restrictive. At least one of the other policies must be used: [`ibm-anyuid-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp), [`ibm-anyuid-hostpath-psp`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/psp/ibm-anyuid-hostpath-psp.yaml), [`ibm-anyuid-hostaccess-psp`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/psp/ibm-anyuid-hostaccess-psp.yaml), or [ibm-privileged-psp`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/psp/ibm-privileged-psp.yaml).

This chart also defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom PodSecurityPolicy using the ICP user interface.

From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
* Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
  kind: PodSecurityPolicy
  metadata:
    name: ibm-odm-psp
  spec:
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    forbiddenSysctls:
    - '*'
    fsGroup:
      ranges:
      - max: 65535
        min: 1
      rule: MustRunAs
    requiredDropCapabilities:
    - ALL
    runAsUser:
      rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
    seLinux:
      rule: RunAsAny
    supplementalGroups:
      ranges:
      - max: 65535
        min: 1
      rule: MustRunAs
    volumes:
    - configMap
    - emptyDir
    - projected
    - secret
    - downwardAPI
    - persistentVolumeClaim
  ```

* Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: ibm-odm-clusterrole
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - extensions
    resourceNames:
    - ibm-odm-psp
    resources:
    - podsecuritypolicies
    verbs:
    - use
  ```

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-restricted-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can proceed to install the chart. However, if you use an internal database (internalDatabase.persistence.enabled=true), the previous SecurityContextConstraints is too restrictive. At least one of the other policies must be used: [`ibm-anyuid-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc), [`ibm-anyuid-hostpath-scc`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/scc/ibm-anyuid-hostpath-scc.yaml), [`ibm-anyuid-hostaccess-scc`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/scc/ibm-anyuid-hostaccess-scc.yaml), or [ibm-privileged-scc`](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-pak/blob/master/spec/security/scc/ibm-privileged-scc.yaml).

This chart also defines a custom SecurityContextConstraints which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart.

From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom SecurityContextConstraints
* Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
  kind: SecurityContextConstraints
  metadata:

| **Total**  | **2000** (2CPU)     | **2048** (2Gb)             |


## Installing the Chart

A release must be configured before it can be installed.
To install a release with the default configuration and a release name of `my-odm-prod-release`, use the following command:

```console
$ helm install --name my-odm-prod-release --set internalDatabase.secretCredentials=my-odm-db-secret stable/ibm-odm-prod
```

> **Tip**: List all existing releases with the `helm list --tls` command.

Using Helm, you specify each parameter with a `--set key=value` argument in the `helm install` command.
For example:

```console
$ helm install --name my-odm-prod-release \
  --set internalDatabase.databaseName=my-db \
  --set internalDatabase.secretCredentials=my-odm-db-secret \
  stable/ibm-odm-prod
```

It is also possible to use a custom-made .yaml file to specify the values of the parameters when you install the chart.
For example:

```console
$ helm install --name my-odm-prod-release -f values.yaml stable/ibm-odm-prod
```

> **Tip**: The default values are in the `values.yaml` file of the `ibm-odm-prod` chart.


The package is deployed asynchronously in a matter of minutes, and is composed of several services.
The release is an instance of the `ibm-odm-prod` chart: all the ODM components are now running in a  Kubernetes cluster.

### Verifying the Chart

Navigate to your release and view the service details. For details, see the **What to do next** section in [Installing a Helm release of ODM for production](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/tsk_config_odm_icp_prod.html).

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall and delete a release named `my-odm-prod-release`, use the following command:

```console
$ helm delete my-odm-prod-release --purge
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart, except any Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).  This is the default behavior of Kubernetes, and ensures that valuable data is not deleted.  In order to delete the ODM data, you can delete the PVC using the following command:

```console
$ kubectl delete pvc <release_name>-odm-pvclaim -n <namespace>
```

## Post-installation Steps

If you have been customizing the default user registry, you will have to synchronize it with the Decision Center database. For details, see
[Synchronizing users and groups in Decision Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/tsk_synchronize_users.html).


## Configuration

To configure the `ibm-odm-prod` chart, check out the list of available [ODM for production configuration parameters](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP76_8.10.x/com.ibm.odm.icp/topics/ref_parameters_prod.html).

## Storage

Use cases for PostgreSQL as an internal database:

- Persistent storage using Kubernetes dynamic provisioning. Uses the default storageclass defined by the Kubernetes admin or by using a custom storageclass which will override the default.
  - Set global values to:
    - internalDatabase.persistence.enabled: true (default)
    - internalDatabase.persistence.useDynamicProvisioning: true
  - Specify a custom storageClassName per volume or leave the value empty to use the default storageClass.


- Persistent storage using a predefined PersistentVolumeClaim or PersistentVolume setup prior to the deployment of this chart
  - Set global values to:
    - internalDatabase.persistence.enabled: true
    - internalDatabase.persistence.useDynamicProvisioning: false (default)
  - Kubernetes binding process selects a pre-existing volume based on the accessMode and size.
