This application deploys pods as deamonsets.  Configuration of the cluster is
done by editing the configuration files located in the Persistant Volume that
the manager pod has used.

Additional information on using the features is available here:

Additional information on configuring the scheduler can be found here:

There is typically no need to interact with the application.  However you can
get a shell on the manager container by running:
  $ kubectl get pods |grep ibm-spectrum
  $ kubectl exec -ti {Name of container} /bin/bash
Now run some commands to test the cluster e.g.
  # lsid       - This checks that the cluster is running
  # lshosts    - This shows a list of hosts and some metrics
  # bhosts     - This shows if the hosts are ready to run work
  # bqueues    - This shows if there are any queued jobs
