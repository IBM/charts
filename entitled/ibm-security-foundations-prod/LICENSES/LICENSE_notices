   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and
translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in
regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended
or successor version of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or
corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent
permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby
overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as
well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
(including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").
Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
(the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. Affirmer offers
the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning
the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation
warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
extent permissible under applicable law. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for
clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. Affirmer
understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this
document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the
Work.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

3.2. Modifications.

The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are
Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
conveyed by this License.

3.3. Required Notices.

You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
Contributor or the Initial Developer.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does
not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by
You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
offer.

3.6. Larger Works.

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.

Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.

You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.

When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if
You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license
steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b)
otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30
days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that
term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ¤ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if
any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

logback-core

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS

"Contribution" means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each subsequent
Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the Program; where
such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor
if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the
Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of
the Program. "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the
Program.

"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
combined with the Program.

"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
including all Contributors.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to the terms
of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,
sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The
patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands
that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set
forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other
entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought
by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set
forth in this Agreement. 3. REQUIREMENTS

A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
own license agreement, provided that:

a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its
license agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions
of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii) effectively
excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost
profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and iv) states
that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
customarily used for software exchange. When the Program is made available in
source code form:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this
Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may not
remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.

Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
originator of the Contribution.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
this Agreement are reserved.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
any resulting litigation.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

javax.annotation-api, javax.servlet-api

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *
*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *
*                                                                      *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

   provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
   reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
   Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and

direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations

reproduction, and  distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this
document.

indirect, to cause the direction or management  of such entity, whether by
contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of  fifty percent (50%) or more of the
outstanding shares, or (iii)  beneficial ownership of such entity.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
permissions granted by this License.

"Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,  including
but not limited to software source code, documentation source,  and
configuration files.

"Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical  transformation or
translation of a Source form, including but not  limited to compiled object
code, generated documentation, and  conversions to other media types.

"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object  form,
made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright  notice that is
included in or attached to the work (an example is  provided in the Appendix
below).

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object  form, that
is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the  editorial revisions,

shall not include works that remain  separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of,  the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor  for

Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For  the purposes
of this definition, "submitted" means any form of  electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent to the Licensor or its  representatives, including

writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on  behalf
of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and  subsequently

2. Grant of Copyright License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor  hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,  royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare  Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and  distribute the Work and
such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor  hereby
grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,  royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent  license to make, have
made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and  otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those  patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily  infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their  Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity  (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the  Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct  or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to  You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such  litigation is filed. Any
patent license granted hereby with respect to  contributions by an individual
employed by an institution or  organization is limited to patent claims where
the individual that is  the author of the Work is also the inventor of the
patent claims  licensed, and where the organization or institution has the right
to  grant such license under applicable grant and research funding  agreements.
No other express or implied licenses are granted.

4. Redistribution.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works  thereof
in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or  Object form,
provided that You meet the following conditions:

1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a  copy of
this License; and

2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating  that
You changed the files; and

3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices  from the
Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not  pertain to any
part of the Derivative Works; and

4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its  distribution, then
any Derivative Works that You distribute must include  a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE  file, excluding those notices
that do not pertain to any part of the  Derivative Works, in at least one of the
following places: within a  NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the  Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative  Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the  NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative  Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE  text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices  cannot be construed as
modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may  provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use,  reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such  Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and  distribution of the Work otherwise
complies with the conditions stated  in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally  submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be  under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional  terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall  supersede or modify the terms
of any separate license agreement you may  have executed with Licensor regarding
such Contributions.

6. Trademarks.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,  trademarks,

WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either  express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or  conditions of TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the  appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks  associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including  negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law  (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,  shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any  direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any  character arising as a result of this License
or out of the use or  inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss  of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and  all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has  been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may  choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,  indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with  this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only  on Your own behalf and
on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any  other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold  each Contributor harmless for any
liability incurred by, or claims  asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such  warranty or additional liability.

4. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone  Database for
  its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database  is explained in BCP
  175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone  Database section 7.

  7.  Database Ownership

    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF document.
    Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work that is in the public
    domain, and is intended to remain in the  public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78
    [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not  apply to the TZ Database or contributions
    that individuals make to  it. Should any claims be made and substantiated
    against the TZ  Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
    Considerations  defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding
    with the  IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF  Trust
    on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the
    database or code waives all rights to future claims in that contribution or
    in the TZ Database.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street, Fifth
 Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
 verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is numbered 2
because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
  authors decide to use it.  You can use it for your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
  can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
  copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
  fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link a
  program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
  recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes
  to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
  and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
  understands that there is no warranty for this free library.  If the library
  is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that
  what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by
  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
  wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will
  individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program
  into proprietary software.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
  General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
  the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated
  libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to
  read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
  ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
  blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
  and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without changing the
  library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to
  running a utility program or application program.  However, in a textual and
  legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the
  original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
  for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
  developers did not use the libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions
  might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
  those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
  themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to permit
  developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your
  freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are
  incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
  changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the
  actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this will lead to faster
  development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
  library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived
  from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
  Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR
                  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a
  notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may
  be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also
  called "this License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so
  as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
  those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has
  been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the Library" means
  either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,
  a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
  modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
  "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
  modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source
  code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
  files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
  library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
  by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running a program
  using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered
  only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of
  the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library
  does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
  and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
  and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
  along with the Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
  at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
  modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
  also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that
    you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
    data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
    than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
    a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
    supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
    that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore,
    Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
    by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
    the square root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
  instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must
  alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
  ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.
  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License
  has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not
  make any other change in these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
  the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
  derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library
  into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
  1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
  machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
  designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
  the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
  though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
  object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
  designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is
  called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a
  derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
  License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
  executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions
  of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable
  is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
  of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
  part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
  the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
  especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
  the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not
  precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
  and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less
  in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of
  whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
  object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
  containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
  directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work
  that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions
  of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided
  that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
  reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
  used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You
  must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays
  copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
  them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
  Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
    (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work
    is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
    "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
    containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
    changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not
    necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
    definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
    to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
    charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
    designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
    materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
    that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
  include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable
  from it.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
  not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
  system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
  the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
  other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
  system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
  together in an executable that you distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
  side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
  covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
  the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
  library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
  things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
    Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be
    distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
    it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
  copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and
  will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
  who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
  their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
  Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you
  do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
  Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
  this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
  the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
  copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
  conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
  compliance by third parties to this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
  that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
  the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
  obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
  of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
  you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
  refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
  countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
  copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
  geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
  of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
  whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
  Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
  exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
  preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
  promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
  STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
  LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
  PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE,
  YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
  THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
  OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
  DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
  A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH
  HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street,
Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not
allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the
successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number
2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to  share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are  intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to  make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some  specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free  Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use  it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this  license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to  use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not  price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you
wish); that you receive source code or can get it if  you want it; that you can
change the software and use pieces of it in  new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these  things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid  distributors
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these  rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you  if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or  for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link other
code with the library, you must provide complete  object files to the
recipients, so that they can relink them with the  library after making changes
to the library and recompiling it. And you  must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the  library,
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal  permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is  no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by  someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they  have is not the
original version, so that the original author's  reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by  others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any  free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively  restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license  from a patent
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license  obtained for a version of
the library must be consistent with the full  freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary  GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public  License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different  from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for  certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into  non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a  shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a  combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary  General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire  combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public  License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the  library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does  Less
to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public  License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an  advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the  reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special  circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to  encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it  becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be  allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library  does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there  is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so  we use the Lesser General
Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free  programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free  software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free  programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system,  as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the  users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked  with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program  using a
modified version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a  "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The  former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must  be combined with the library in order
to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other  program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other  authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this  Lesser General
Public License (also called "this License"). Each  licensee is addressed as
"you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data  prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs  (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which  has
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"  means either
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:  that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either  verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into  another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without  limitation in the term
"modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the  source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface  definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and  installation of the
library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not  covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running  a program using
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a  program is covered only
if its contents constitute a work based on the  Library (independent of the use
of the Library in a tool for writing  it). Whether that is true depends on what
the Library does and what the  program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete  source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices  that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and  distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and  you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of  it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute  such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided  that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause
    the files modified to carry prominent notices  stating that you changed the
    files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to
    be licensed at no charge  to all third parties under the terms of this
    License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses  the
    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility  is invoked,
    then you must make a good faith effort to ensure  that, in the event an
    application does not supply such function  or table, the facility still
    operates, and performs whatever part  of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has  a
      purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the  application.
      Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any  application-supplied function
      or table used by this function must  be optional: if the application does
      not supply it, the square  root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If  identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and  can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those  sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on  the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this  License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest  your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on
the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library  with the
Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a  storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the  scope of this
License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public  License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do  this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that  they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,  instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the  ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify  that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these  notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that  copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all  subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the  Library
into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative  of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the  terms of Sections
1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the  complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be  distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source  code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the  source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the  source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,  but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked  with it, is
called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in  isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls  outside the scope of this
License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates  an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains  portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library".  The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states  terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file  that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a  derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not.  Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked  without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold  for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure  layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten  lines or less
in length), then the use of the object file is  unrestricted, regardless of
whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
code plus portions of the Library  will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may  distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.  Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether  or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a  "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work  containing portions
of the Library, and distribute that work under terms  of your choice, provided
that the terms permit modification of the work  for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such  modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the  Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by  this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during  execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright  notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the  user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding  machine-readable
    source code for the Library including whatever  changes were used in the
    work (which must be distributed under  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
    work is an executable linked  with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable "work that  uses the Library", as object code and/or source
    code, so that the  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
    modified  executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in  the Library
    will not necessarily be able to recompile the  application to use the
    modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
    linking with the  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run
    time a  copy of the library already present on the user's computer  system,
    rather than copying library functions into the  executable, and (2) will
    operate properly with a modified version  of the library, if the user
    installs one, as long as the modified  version is interface-compatible with
    the version that the work  was made with. c) Accompany the work with a
    written offer, valid for at least three  years, to give the same user the
    materials specified in  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the
    cost of  performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is
    made by offering access to copy  from a designated place, offer equivalent
    access to copy the  above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify
    that the user has already received a copy of these  materials or that you
    have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"  must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the  executable
from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be  distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in  either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler,  kernel, and so on) of the operating
system on which the executable runs,  unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions  of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the  operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them  and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities  not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library,  provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library  and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided  that you do these two
things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  on the
    Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This must be
    distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice
    with the combined library of the fact that  part of it is a work based on
    the Library, and explaining where  to find the accompanying uncombined form
    of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the  Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the  Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this  License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you  under this License will not have
their licenses terminated so long as  such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Library (or
any work based on the  Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all  its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the  Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the  Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library  subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with  this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute  so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and  any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not  distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would  not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Library by all those who  receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you  could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from  distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under  any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to  apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented  by public license practices. Many
people have made generous  contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that  system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to  the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be  a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in  certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original
copyright holder who places the Library under this License may  add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those  countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries  not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the  limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new  versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may  differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library  specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any  later version",
you have the option of following the terms and  conditions either of that
version or of any later version published by  the Free Software Foundation. If
the Library does not specify a license  version number, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free  Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free  programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,  write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is  copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software  Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be  guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives  of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software  generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO  WARRANTY FOR
THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR  OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,  EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED  WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH  YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL  NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN  WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY  AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR  DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED  INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF  THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR  OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> Everyone is
 permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
 changing it is not allowed.

  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms
  and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by
  the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
  Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General
  Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
  Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
  Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
  of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
  provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application
  with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the
  Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
  Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
  Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
  not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code
  and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility
  programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but
  excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
  being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
  refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
  facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
  you may convey a copy of the modified version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
   that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
   facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
   meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
   applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
  file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms
  of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
  numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
  inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
  the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
   is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
  together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the
  Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
  such modifications, if you also do each of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library
   is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
   include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
   a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
       and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
       Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
       modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
       GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
       A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the
       Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will
       operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
       interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
   required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
   to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
   modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
   the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
   option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
   Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
   4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
   section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
  side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
  Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
  library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
   Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
   terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
   based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
   uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
  GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
  similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
  new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
  received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version
  or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
  Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General
  Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
  future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
  proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
  authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this  license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software  and
other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to  take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the  GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free  software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  GNU General Public License for most
of our software; it applies also to  any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to  your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the  freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if  you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it,  that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free  programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these  rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis  or for
a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that  you received.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their  rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)  assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving  you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains  that
there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and  authors' sake,
the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  changed, so that their
problems will not be attributed erroneously to  authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting  users' freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such  abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is  precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed  this version of the GPL to prohibit
the practice for those products. If  such problems arise substantially in other
domains, we stand ready to  extend this provision to those domains in future
versions of the GPL, as  needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could  make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds  of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this  License.
Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and  "recipients" may be
individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the  work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making  of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version"  of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based  on the
Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without  permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for  infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a  computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying,  distribution (with or without modification),
making available to the  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other  parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through  a computer
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"  to the
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible  feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells  the user that there is
no warranty for the work (except to the extent  that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under  this License, and how to view a copy
of this License. If the interface  presents a list of user commands or options,
such as a menu, a prominent  item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work  for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source  form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official  standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of  interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is  widely used among developers
working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other  than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of  packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major  Component, and (b) serves only
to enable use of the work with that Major  Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an  implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A  "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential  component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating  system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to  produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all  the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable  work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to  control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System  Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs  which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are  not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes  interface definition files associated with source
files for the work,  and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked  subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms  and
other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can  regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same  work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated  conditions are met. This
License explicitly affirms your unlimited  permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a  covered work is covered by this License only
if the output, given its  content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,  without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having  them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with  facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the  terms of this License in conveying all
material for which you do not  control copyright. Those thus making or running
the covered works for  you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your
direction and  control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your  copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes  it
unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological  measure
under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11  of the WIPO
copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar  laws prohibiting or
restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention  is
effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the  covered
work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or  modification of the
work as a means of enforcing, against the work's  users, your or third parties'
legal rights to forbid circumvention of  technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you  receive it,
in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and  appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep  intact all notices stating that
this License and any non-permissive  terms added in accord with section 7 apply
to the code; keep intact all  notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
all recipients a copy  of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and  you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to  produce it
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms  of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,  and
 giving a relevant date.  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that
 it is released  under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
 This  requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all
 notices".

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to  anyone
 who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
 with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
 all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
 permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
 such  permission if you have separately received it.

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display  Appropriate
 Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive  interfaces that do not
 display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent  works,
which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and  which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or  on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium, is called an  "aggregate" if the compilation and
its resulting copyright are not  used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users  beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in  an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of  the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of  sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable  Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these  ways:

 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by the  Corresponding Source fixed
 on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product  (including a
 physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
 least three years and valid for  as long as you offer spare parts or customer
 support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
 either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the  software in the
 product that is covered by this License, on a  durable physical medium
 customarily used for software  interchange, for a price no more than your
 reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
 access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the  written
 offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
 occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with
 such an offer, in accord with  subsection 6b.

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place  (gratis
 or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the  Corresponding Source in
 the same way through the same place at no  further charge. You need not require
 recipients to copy the  Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the
 place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may
 be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)  that supports
 equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
 the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of
 what server hosts the  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure
 that it is  available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you  inform
 other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are
 being offered to the general public at no charge under  subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded  from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included  in conveying the
object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal,  family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for  incorporation into a dwelling.
In determining whether a product is a  consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a
particular user, "normally  used" refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product,  regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which  the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use,
the  product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the  product
has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,  unless such uses
represent the only significant mode of use of the  product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,  procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install  and execute
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product  from a modified
version of its Corresponding Source. The information  must suffice to ensure
that the continued functioning of the modified  object code is in no case
prevented or interfered with solely because  modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as  part of a
transaction in which the right of possession and use of the  User Product is
transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a  fixed term (regardless of
how the transaction is characterized), the  Corresponding Source conveyed under
this section must be accompanied by  the Installation Information. But this
requirement does not apply if  neither you nor any third party retains the
ability to install modified  object code on the User Product (for example, the
work has been  installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates  for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for  the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a  network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and  adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and  protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in  accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented  (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code  form), and must require
no special password or key for unpacking,  reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this  License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.  Additional permissions
that are applicable to the entire Program shall  be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent  that they are valid under applicable
law. If additional permissions  apply only to part of the Program, that part may
be used separately  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
governed by this  License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove  any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in  certain cases when
you modify the work.) You may place additional  permissions on material, added
by you to a covered work, for which you  have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you  add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders  of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the  terms of
 sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or  author
 attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by
 works containing it; or

 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or  requiring
 that modified versions of such material be marked in  reasonable ways as
 different from the original version; or

 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or  authors of
 the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of
 some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material  by
 anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
 assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
 contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further  restrictions"
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you  received it, or any
part of it, contains a notice stating that it is  governed by this License along
with a term that is a further  restriction, you may remove that term. If a
license document contains a  further restriction but permits relicensing or
conveying under this  License, you may add to a covered work material governed
by the terms of  that license document, provided that the further restriction
does not  survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must  place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms  that apply to
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the  applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the  form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above  requirements
apply either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly  provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or  modify it is void,
and will automatically terminate your rights under  this License (including any
patent licenses granted under the third  paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license  from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,  unless and until
the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates  your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to  notify you of the violation by
some reasonable means prior to 60 days  after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by  some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice  of violation
of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,  and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the  notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the  licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under  this License. If
your rights have been terminated and not permanently  reinstated, you do not
qualify to receive new licenses for the same  material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a  copy
of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring  solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a  copy likewise does
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than  this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered  work. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this  License. Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you  indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically  receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and  propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible  for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who  receives
a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work  the party's
predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous  paragraph, plus a
right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the  work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can  get it with
reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the  rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not  impose a
license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights  granted under this
License, and you may not initiate litigation  (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any  patent claim is infringed by
making, using, selling, offering for sale,  or importing the Program or any
portion of it.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this  License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work  thus licensed is
called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims  owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or  hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by  this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but  do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of  further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this  definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses  in a manner consistent with the requirements of this
License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free  patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,  use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and  propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express  agreement
or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent  (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to  sue for patent
infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a  party means to make such
an agreement or commitment not to enforce a  patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and  the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to  copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a  publicly available
network server or other readily accessible means,  then you must either (1)
cause the Corresponding Source to be so  available, or (2) arrange to deprive
yourself of the benefit of the  patent license for this particular work, or (3)
arrange, in a manner  consistent with the requirements of this License, to
extend the patent  license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means
you have  actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work  in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that  country that
you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or  arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a  covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties  receiving the covered work authorizing
them to use, propagate, modify or  convey a specific copy of the covered work,
then the patent license you  grant is automatically extended to all recipients
of the covered work  and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within  the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned  on the non-exercise
of one or more of the rights that are specifically  granted under this License.
You may not convey a covered work if you are  a party to an arrangement with a
third party that is in the business of  distributing software, under which you
make payment to the third party  based on the extent of your activity of
conveying the work, and under  which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive  the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in  connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
copies  made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless  you
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,  prior to 28
March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any  implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be  available to
you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not  excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a  covered work so
as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this  License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you  may not convey it at all. For
example, if you agree to terms that  obligate you to collect a royalty for
further conveying from those to  whom you convey the Program, the only way you
could satisfy both those  terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the  Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission  to
link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3  of the
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,  and to convey
the resulting work. The terms of this License will  continue to apply to the
part which is the covered work, but the special  requirements of the GNU Affero
General Public License, section 13,  concerning interaction through a network
will apply to the combination  as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of  the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will  be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to  address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public  License "or any later
version" applies to it, you have the option of  following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of  any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the  Program does not specify a version number
of the GNU General Public  License, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software  Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions  of the
GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public  statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to  choose that version for
the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or  copyright
holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY  APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF  THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR  CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT  NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE  WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above  cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing  courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute  waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a  warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in  return for a fee.

“Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United States Patent

Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus for Facilitating
Efficient  Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility, divisional, provisional,
continuation,  continuations-in-part, reexamination, reissue, or foreign
counterpart patents that  may issue with respect to the aforesaid patent

7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675; and any patent  that issues out
of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention claimed in the
Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on a
user-programmable,  general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
computer-readable medium storing  such software. Software Implementation does
not include, for example, application-specific  integrated circuits (ASICs),
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems,  or IP cores.

1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published and
made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the source
code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify, and
distribute the source code without payment of  fees or royalties, or (b) the
source code is in the public domain, including code released  for public use
through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source Initiative  at
opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons licenses

Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software Implementation.  2.2 Restriction.
If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation (including, but not
limited to, a cross-claim  or counterclaim in a lawsuit) against any entity
alleging that any Use authorized by this license infringes  another patent, then
any rights granted to you under this license automatically terminate as of the
date  such litigation is filed.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).
In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/)
was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open
Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.
All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version
without making your changes open source.  The GPL-compatible licenses make it
possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL;
the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its
license has a choice of law clause.  According to CNRI, however, Stallman's
lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to
make these releases possible.
