LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International Program License Agreement (Z125-3301-14) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM Cloud Pak for Automation 19.0.1 (5737-I23)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Multi-Product Install Image

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.

Bundled Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Bundled Programs identified below. A Bundled Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Bundled Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Bundled Program's terms. The Principal Program and any Bundled Programs are all part of the Program, as a whole. Therefore, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Bundled Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Bundled Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Bundled Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Bundled Programs:
IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise 19.0.0
IBM Business Automation Workflow Enterprise for Non-Production Environment 19.0.0
IBM Operational Decision Manager Server 8.10.2
IBM Operational Decision Manager Server for Non-Production Environment 8.10.2

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Notwithstanding the existence of any confidentiality or other agreement Licensee may have with IBM pertaining to confidential information, the preceding paragraphs will govern the treatment of the IBM Confidential Information.

Export and Import Restrictions

This Program may contain cryptography. Transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. restrictions on exports or reexports. To obtain the export classification of this Program refer to: https://www.ibm.com/products/exporting/.

Third Party Data and Services

The Program may contain links to or be used to access third party data services, databases, web services, software, or other third party content (all, "content"). Access to this content is provided "AS-IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Access can be terminated by the relevant third parties at their sole discretion at any time. Licensee may be required to enter into separate agreements with the third parties for the access to or use of such content. IBM is not a party to any such separate agreements and as an express condition of this license Licensee agrees to comply with the terms of such separate agreements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Establishment

Establishment is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Establishment is a single physical site, including the surrounding campus and satellite offices located within 50 kilometers, of Licensee's site address. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Establishment at or for which the Program will be used. Licensee is permitted to deploy an unlimited number of copies of the Program within the Establishment. An entitlement for an Establishment is unique to that Establishment and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent closing of the Establishment.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Bundled Program Entitlement Details

Each entitlement of the Program is equivalent to the indicated Entitlement Value of any one of the Bundled Programs, at Licensee's election, but not both (or all). If Licensee has more than one entitlement to the Program, Licensee may allocate between corresponding Entitlement Values of one or more of the Bundled Programs in a deployment combination of Licensee's choosing, provided that the sum of Licensee's usage of Entitlement Values of all the Bundled Programs does not exceed the total entitlements to the Program. Units of measure referenced in the below list of Entitlement Values are as defined in the license for the Bundled Program.

Depending on the agreements between IBM and the Licensee, Licensee may have committed that when obtaining S&S they would do so for all uses and installations of an IBM Program. For the purposes of any such commitment, the individual Bundled Programs are the IBM Programs subject to that S&S commitment and to the extent that Licensee is obligated to acquire S&S for a Bundled Program, Licensee can satisfy that obligation as to the entitlements obtained under this Program by maintaining S&S for this Program as a whole.
