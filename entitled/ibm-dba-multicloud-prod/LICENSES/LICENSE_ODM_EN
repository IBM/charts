The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Multi-Product Install Image

The Program is provided as part of a multi-product install image. Licensee is authorized to install and use only the Program (and its Bundled or Supporting Programs, if any) for which a valid entitlement is obtained and may not install or use any of the other software included in the image unless Licensee has acquired separate entitlements for that other software.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Licensee may be required to enter into separate agreements with the third parties for the access to or use of such content. IBM is not a party to any such separate agreements and as an express condition of this license Licensee agrees to comply with the terms of such separate agreements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the PVU Table by Processor Vendor, Brand, Type and Model Number at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program using either Full Capacity licensing or Virtualization Capacity (Sub-Capacity) licensing according to the Passport Advantage Sub-Capacity Licensing Terms (see webpage below). If using Full Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores* in the physical hardware environment made available to or managed by the Program, except for those servers from which the Program has been permanently removed. If using Virtualization Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores made available to or managed by the Program, as defined according to the Virtualization Capacity License Counting Rules at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/Counting_Software_licenses_using_specific_virtualization_technologies.html.

* An Activated processor core is a processor core that is available for use in a physical or virtual server, regardless of whether the capacity of the processor core can be or is limited through virtualization technologies, operating system commands, BIOS settings, or similar restrictions.

Resource Value Unit (RVU)

Resource Value Unit (RVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. RVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number of units of a specific resource used or managed by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment for the specific resources as specified in the table below. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Establishment

Establishment is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Establishment is a single physical site, including the surrounding campus and satellite offices located within 50 kilometers, of Licensee's site address. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Establishment at or for which the Program will be used. Licensee is permitted to deploy an unlimited number of copies of the Program within the Establishment. An entitlement for an Establishment is unique to that Establishment and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent closing of the Establishment.

Monthly Million Rules Decisions

Monthly Million Rules Decisions is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Rules Decision is the outcome of invoking a ruleset from a rule execution server. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the number of Rules Decisions, rounded up to the nearest Million, executed or processed by the Program in any calendar month.

Monthly Thousand Managed Decision Artifacts

Monthly Thousand Managed Decision Artifacts is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Managed Decision Artifact is an object managed by the Program. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the number of Decision Artifacts rounded up to the nearest Thousand, managed by the Program in any calendar month.

Cumulative Entitlements

Establishment, Monthly Thousand Managed Decision Artifacts, and Monthly Million Rules Decisions entitlements are not alternative means for licensing the Program. Licensee must obtain the appropriate number of Establishment entitlements as well as the appropriate number of Monthly Million Rules Decisions entitlements and the appropriate number of Monthly Thousand Managed Decision Artifacts entitlements.

Resource Value Unit Measure

The Resource for the purpose of the RVU calculation is Client Device. A Client Device is a single user computing device or special purpose sensor or telemetry device that requests the execution of or receives for execution a set of commands, procedures, or applications from or provides data to another computer system that is typically referred to as a server or is otherwise managed by the server. Multiple Client Devices may share access to a common server. A Client Device may have some processing capability or be programmable to allow a user to do work. Examples include, but are not limited to actuators, appliances, automated teller machines, automatic meter readers, cash registers, disk drives, desktop computers, kiosks, notebook computers, personal digital assistant, point-of-sale terminals, sensors, smart meters, tape drives, and technical workstations.

Resource Value Unit Conversion Table

From 1 to 20 Resources, 1.00 RVUs per Resource

From 21 to 50 Resources, 20 RVUs plus 0.83 RVUs per Resource above 20

From 51 to 100 Resources, 45 RVUs plus 0.80 RVUs per Resource above 50

From 101 to 250 Resources, 85 RVUs plus 0.76 RVUs per Resource above 100

From 251 to 500 Resources, 199 RVUs plus 0.60 RVUs per Resource above 250

From 501 to 1,000 Resources, 349 RVUs plus 0.50 RVUs per Resource above 500

From 1,001 to 5,000 Resources, 599 RVUs plus 0.47 RVUs per Resource above 1,000

From 5,001 to 10,000 Resources, 2,479 RVUs plus 0.40 RVUs per Resource above 5,000

From 10,001 to 25,000 Resources, 4,479 RVUs plus 0.36 RVUs per Resource above 10,000

For more than 25,000 Resources, 9,879 RVUs plus 0.33 RVUs per Resource above 25,000

In addition to entitlements required for use of the Program, Licensee must obtain Program entitlements for any servers or Client Devices on which business rules, which are created using the Program or are derived by translation of the rules created using the Program into another rule language or executable format, are executed.

All components of the Program when used only for augmenting an existing, compatible Deployment Manager ("DMGR") profile and supporting the remote administration and network deployment of the Program.

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program component(s) are not taken into consideration when used for Development and Functional Test purposes:

- Rule Execution Server
- Classic rule engine
- Decision engine
- Decision Runner
- Scenario Service Provider
- Sample Server
- Insight Runtime Server
- Decision Center

Use of the Program and Components when used for Development and Functional Test purposes:

Under Development and Functional Test use, the Program or components can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development, unit, and functional testing environments. In functional test environments the developer can integrate their code with that of others on shared use machines, and that code can be tested in a test harness. Functional testing is limited to ensuring that the Program can be used to connect to local or remote endpoints, and that a sample of data sent between those endpoints is processed correctly. Licensee is not authorized to use the Program or components for system test, meaning integrated code is tested as a product, processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing the scalability of any code, application or system.

- When determining the number of Establishment entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, components of the Program when integrated into an application installed outside the Establishment, are not taken into consideration.

Supporting Program Details

IBM Integration Bus Advanced:

- Use Limitations: Development and Functional Testing

"Development and Functional Testing" means that the Supporting Program can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development, unit, and functional testing environments. Licensee is not authorized to use the Program for processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Supporting Program for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.

IBM WebSphere eXtreme Scale

- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

IBM DB2 Advanced Workgroup Server Edition

- Entitlement: No Metric

- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the Supporting Program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to the Principal Program, as well).

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration.

"Nonsupported" means the Supporting Program is provided without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
