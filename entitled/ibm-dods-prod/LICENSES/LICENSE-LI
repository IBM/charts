Benchmarking

Licensee may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the Program or its subcomponents to any third party provided that Licensee (A) publicly discloses the complete methodology used in the benchmark test (for example, hardware and software setup, installation procedure and configuration files), (B) performs Licensee's benchmark testing running the Program in its Specified Operating Environment using the latest applicable updates, patches and fixes available for the Program from IBM or third parties that provide IBM products ("Third Parties"), and (C) follows any and all performance tuning and "best practices" guidance available in the Program's documentation and on IBM's support web sites for the Program. If Licensee publishes the results of any benchmark tests for the Program, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement between Licensee and IBM or Third Parties, IBM and Third Parties will have the right to publish the results of benchmark tests with respect to Licensee's products provided IBM or Third Parties complies with the requirements of (A), (B) and (C) above in its testing of Licensee's products.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances may Licensee publish the results of benchmark tests run on Oracle Outside In Technology without prior written permission.

The above benchmarking terms apply to the following Programs or subcomponents:
IBM Decision Optimization for Data Science Experience

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.
