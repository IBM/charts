1. Test that MMA is alive using the following commands:
  echo "Port forward to model-management-api service on port 4000"
  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-ibm-watson-mma-prod-model-management-api 4000:4000 --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

TODO: Add a test curl for MMA v1

TODO: Add a test curl for MMA v2

These should be tests can be added later, but they should really test real funcitonality if possible. I don't think a health check is sufficient since the pod already has health and readiness probes.
