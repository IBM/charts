IMPORTANT: READ CAREFULLY

Two license agreements are presented below.

1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs
2. IBM International Program License Agreement

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for purposes of productive use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts the IBM International Program License Agreement, without modification.

If Licensee is obtaining the Program for the purpose of evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration (collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, Licensee accepts both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement (the "IPLA"), without modification.

The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Licensee's Evaluation.

The IPLA will automatically apply if Licensee elects to retain the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements).

The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the other.

The complete text of each of these two license agreements follow.



LICENSE INFORMATION

The Programs listed below are licensed under the following License Information terms and conditions in addition to the Program license terms previously agreed to by Client and IBM. If Client does not have previously agreed to license terms in effect for the Program, the International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs (Z125-5543-05) applies.

Program Name (Program Number):
IBM UrbanCode Deploy Managed Capacity 7.1.1 (Evaluation)
IBM UrbanCode Deploy Server Agent 7.1.1 (Evaluation)
IBM UrbanCode Deploy Session 7.1.1 (Evaluation)
IBM UrbanCode Deploy Agent for z/OS Workloads 7.1.1 (Evaluation)
IBM UrbanCode Deploy Session for z/OS Workloads 7.1.1 (Evaluation)
IBM UrbanCode Deploy on ICP Virtual Process Core 7.1.1 (Evaluation)

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Evaluation Period

The evaluation period begins on the date that Licensee agrees to the terms of this Agreement and ends after 60 days.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a VPC (Virtual Processor Core) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 10 VPC machine and another Supporting Program on a second 10 VPC machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 20 VPC entitlements to the Program.

Supporting Programs:
IBM DB2 Standard Edition VPC Option 11.5

Separately Licensed Code

Each of the components listed in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file is considered "Separately Licensed Code" licensed to Licensee under the terms of the applicable third party license agreement(s) set forth in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s) that accompanies the Program, and not this Agreement. Future Program updates or fixes may contain additional Separately Licensed Code. Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in the applicable NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. 

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code: 
(a) IBM provides it to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE;
(b) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits.

Program Keys

For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.

Program Keys

For Programs which require keys to operate, Licensee may not have more keys to the Program in Licensee's Enterprise than Licensee has entitlements.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Managed Virtual Server

Managed Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Managed Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server managed by the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the Processor Value Unit (PVU) licensing for Distributed Software website at https://supportcontent.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-processor-value-unit-pvu-licensing-distributed-software) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program (if supported) using full capacity licensing, sub-capacity licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/subcaplicensing.html), or container licensing (https://www.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/containerlicenses.html). See the linked websites for more information.

Instead of the entitlements required for the Program directly, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements for this Program sufficient to cover the processor cores for the systems on which the resources managed or processed by the Program reside.

Simultaneous Session

Simultaneous Session is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A session is an active file transfer or other active communications connection between the Program running on one physical or virtual computer and any software running on another physical or virtual computer. Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover the highest number of sessions that are or have been simultaneously in existence across all instances or copies of the Program.

Virtual Server

Virtual Server is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate server. A virtual server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical server or an unpartitioned physical server. Licensee must obtain Virtual Server entitlements for each virtual server made available to the Program, regardless of the number of processor cores in the virtual server or the number of copies of the Program on the virtual server.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

When licensing IBM UrbanCode Deploy Server Agent, Virtual Server and Managed Virtual Server entitlements are not alternative means for licensing the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient Virtual Server entitlements to cover the relevant servers where the Program's Server component is installed as well as sufficient Managed Virtual Server entitlements to cover the relevant servers where the Program's Agent component is installed. Licensee may use Managed Virtual Server entitlements acquired for either IBM UrbanCode Deploy Server Agent or IBM UrbanCode Deploy Agent for z/OS Workloads, as applicable based on system requirements, to meet this entitlement requirement
