Export and Import Restrictions

This Program may contain cryptography. Transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. restrictions on exports or reexports. To obtain the export classification of this Program refer to: https://www.ibm.com/products/exporting/.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Processor Value Unit (PVU)

Processor Value Unit (PVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. The number of PVU entitlements required is based on the processor technology (defined within the PVU Table by Processor Vendor, Brand, Type and Model Number at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/pvu_licensing_for_customers.html) and the number of processors made available to the Program. IBM continues to define a processor, for the purpose of PVU-based licensing, to be each processor core on a chip. A dual-core processor chip, for example, has two processor cores.

Licensee can deploy the Program using either Full Capacity licensing or Virtualization Capacity (Sub-Capacity) licensing according to the Passport Advantage Sub-Capacity Licensing Terms (see webpage below). If using Full Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain PVU entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores* in the physical hardware environment made available to or managed by the Program, except for those servers from which the Program has been permanently removed. If using Virtualization Capacity licensing, Licensee must obtain entitlements sufficient to cover all activated processor cores made available to or managed by the Program, as defined according to the Virtualization Capacity License Counting Rules at http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/passportadvantage/Counting_Software_licenses_using_specific_virtualization_technologies.html.

* An Activated processor core is a processor core that is available for use in a physical or virtual server, regardless of whether the capacity of the processor core can be or is limited through virtualization technologies, operating system commands, BIOS settings, or similar restrictions.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Physical Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Physical Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a Physical Server or an unpartitioned Physical Server. A Processor Core (commonly called a processor or CPU) is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core in an unpartitioned Physical Server, or a virtual core assigned to a Virtual Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

For the purposes of this Program, and as long as the required metering tool is actually used, then entitlements need only be obtained for a maximum of 160 Hours per calendar month for each VPC made available to each Instance of the Program.


1. Components Not Used for Establishing Required Entitlements

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, the installation or use of the following Program components are not taken into consideration. In other words, Licensee may install and use the following Program components, under the license terms, but these components are not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.

Use of the Program on a Developer Machine for development and unit test purposes.

A Developer Machine is defined as a physical or virtual desktop environment, running a primary operating system and the Program, both of which are accessible and used by no more than one (1) specified developer. The physical or virtual desktop environments include on-premises and off-premises cloud environments. The Program and these component(s) cannot be used for production purposes, including processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Program component(s) for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.

Use as a Build Server 

A Build Server is defined as a machine, physical or virtual, in which the Program is installed but has not been started with the exception of the server package command, the Program libraries can be used for Program application and server builds in support of the licensed Program.

Subject to the components not used for establishing required entitlements clause above, Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to cover the use of the Program on every machine where the Program is installed as specified in this Agreement, which includes, but is not limited to, the Deployment Manager, Job Manager, and Collective Controller components of the Program.

2. Other IBM Application Server Solutions 

Licensee may use the Program to manage copies of the Application Server component that have been acquired under a WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment or WebSphere Application Server for z/OS license. Licensee may not use the Program to manage copies of the Application Server component acquired as part of a WebSphere Application Server, WebSphere Application Server - Express, or WebSphere Application Server Liberty Core license, except when using the Job Manager or the Collective Controller components of the Program. The Job Manager and Collective Controller components can be used with the administrative agents of any WebSphere Application Server edition. Licensee may use the Program to manage copies of the separately acquired WebSphere Virtual Enterprise offering.

3. IBM Security Access Manager Virtual Edition and IBM Security Access Manager Virtual Edition Federation Module

Licensee is authorized to use IBM Security Access Manager Virtual Edition and IBM Security Access Manager Virtual Edition Federation Module exclusively to implement single sign-on federations for up to two federation partners. 

4. Licensee use of the Program using the Virtual Processor Core-Instance-Hours metric is limited to use in Docker and Cloud Foundry container deployments.

"Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the Supporting Program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to the Principal Program, as well).

"Unrestricted" means that, notwithstanding the language above, Licensee's right to use the Supporting Program is not limited to use only in support of Licensee's use of the Principal Program. While the other restrictions on Licensee's use of the Supporting Program continue to apply, Licensee may use the Supporting Program for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program.

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, program or device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration 

"Non-Production" means that the Supporting Program can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development and test environment for internal non-production activities, including but not limited to testing, performance tuning, fault diagnosis, internal benchmarking, staging, quality assurance activity and/or developing internally used additions or extensions to the Program using published application programming interfaces. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Supporting Program for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.

"Non-supported" means the Supporting Programs are provided without obligation of support when used for purposes independent of the licensed use of the Principal Program, and for those uses are "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Install is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. An Install is an installed copy or instance of the Supporting Program on a physical or virtual disk made available to be executed on a computer. Licensee must obtain an entitlement for each Install of the Supporting Program.

Monthly API Call is a unit of measure by which the Supporting Program can be licensed. An API Call is the invocation of the Program via a programmable interface. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the maximum number of API Calls in any calendar month.

"No Metric" means this Supporting Program may be installed on as many machines and used by as many persons as is reasonably necessary within the use limitations that apply to this Supporting Program.
