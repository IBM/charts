Data Science Experience (DSX) is delivered as an interconnected set of pods and kubernetes services. DSX Local supports one installation per cluster.

A unique node port must be selected to be able to access the DSX web application.

Check the deployments and when cloudant, redis, usermgmt, dsx-core, ibm-nginx are up and ready, you can access the DSX UI by visiting:

https://<cluster_ip>:{{ .Values.dsxservice.externalPort }}/

Also, to ensure a quick launch of notebooks, ensure that the preload jobs have completed.

Default login is: admin/password
