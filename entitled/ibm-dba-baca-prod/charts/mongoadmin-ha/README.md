## MongoAdmin

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a cross-platform document-oriented database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.
This MongoAdmin chart is used for the binary data storage for IBMÂ® Business Automation Content Analyzer.
