# UrbanCode Deploy Agent - Helm Chart

[UrbanCode Deploy Agent](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/products/urbancode-deploy/) is a tool for automating application deployments through your environments. It is designed to facilitate rapid feedback and continuous delivery in agile development while providing the audit trails, versioning and approvals needed in production.

## Introduction

This chart deploys a single instance of the UrbanCode Deploy agent.

## Chart Details
* Includes a StatefulSet workload object

## Prerequisites

1. The agent must have a UrbanCode Deploy server or relay to connect to.

2. A PersistentVolume that will hold the conf directory for the UrbanCode Deploy agent is required.  If your cluster supports dynamic volume provisioning you will not need to create a PersistentVolume (PV) or PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) before installing this chart.  If your cluster does not support dynamic volume provisioning, you will need to either ensure a PV is available or you will need to create one before installing this chart.  You can optionally create the PVC to bind it to a specific PV, or you can let the chart create a PVC and bind to any available PV that meets the required size and storage class.  Sample YAML to create the PV and PVC are provided below.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ucda-conf-vol
  labels:
    volume: ucda-conf-vol
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Mi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  nfs:
    server: 192.168.1.17
    path: /volume1/k8/ucda-conf
---
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ucda-conf-volc
spec:
  storageClassName: ""
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Mi
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      volume: ucda-conf-vol
```

Example setup scripts to create the Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim are included in the Helm chart under pak_extensions/pre-install/persistentStorageAdministration directory.

### PodSecurityPolicy Requirements

This chart requires a PodSecurityPolicy to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. Choose either a predefined PodSecurityPolicy or have your cluster administrator create a custom PodSecurityPolicy for you.

The predefined PodSecurityPolicy named [`ibm-restricted-psp`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-psp) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this PodSecurityPolicy you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom PodSecurityPolicy which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom PodSecurityPolicy using the Cluster Console user interface or the supplied instructions/scripts in the pak_extension pre-install directory.

* From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom PodSecurityPolicy
  * Custom PodSecurityPolicy definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: PodSecurityPolicy
    metadata:
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/description: "This policy is based on the most restrictive policy,
        requiring pods to run with a non-root UID, and preventing pods from accessing the host."
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default
        seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: docker/default
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-psp
    spec:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      forbiddenSysctls:
      - '*'
      fsGroup:
        ranges:
        - max: 65535
          min: 1
        rule: MustRunAs
      hostNetwork: false
      hostPID: false
      hostIPC: false
      requiredDropCapabilities:
      - ALL
      runAsUser:
        rule: MustRunAsNonRoot
      seLinux:
        rule: RunAsAny
      supplementalGroups:
        ranges:
        - max: 65535
          min: 1
        rule: MustRunAs
      volumes:
      - configMap
      - emptyDir
      - projected
      - secret
      - downwardAPI
      - persistentVolumeClaim
    ```
  * Custom ClusterRole for the custom PodSecurityPolicy:
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-clusterrole
    rules:
    - apiGroups:
      - extensions
      resourceNames:
      - ibm-ucd-prod-psp
      resources:
      - podsecuritypolicies
      verbs:
      - use
    ```
  * RoleBinding for all service accounts in the current namespace. Replace `{{ NAMESPACE }}` in the template with the actual namespace.
    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-rolebinding
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: ibm-ucd-prod-clusterrole
    subjects:
    - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Group
      name: system:serviceaccounts:{{ NAMESPACE }}
    ```
* From the command line, you can run the setup scripts included under pak_extensions.

  As a cluster administrator, the pre-install scripts and instructions are located at:
  * pre-install/clusterAdministration/createSecurityClusterPrereqs.sh

  As team admin/operator the namespace scoped scripts and instructions are located at:
  * pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

If running in a Red Hat OpenShift cluster, this chart requires a `SecurityContextConstraints` to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre and post actions that need to occur.

The predefined `SecurityContextConstraints` name: [`ibm-restricted-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this `SecurityContextConstraints` resource you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart defines a custom `SecurityContextConstraints` which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom `SecurityContextConstraints` resource using the supplied instructions or scripts in the `pak_extensions/pre-install` directory.

* From the user interface, you can copy and paste the following snippets to enable the custom `SecurityContextConstraints`
  * Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
  kind: SecurityContextConstraints
  metadata:
    annotations:
    name: ibm-ucd-prod-scc
  allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
  allowHostIPC: false
  allowHostNetwork: false
  allowHostPID: false
  allowHostPorts: false
  allowPrivilegedContainer: false
  allowedCapabilities: []
  allowedFlexVolumes: []
  defaultAddCapabilities: []
  defaultPrivilegeEscalation: false
  forbiddenSysctls:
    - "*"
  fsGroup:
    type: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - max: 65535
      min: 1
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
  runAsUser:
    type: MustRunAsNonRoot
  seccompProfiles:
  - docker/default
  seLinuxContext:
    type: RunAsAny
  supplementalGroups:
    type: MustRunAs
    ranges:
    - max: 65535
      min: 1
  volumes:
  - configMap
  - downwardAPI
  - emptyDir
  - persistentVolumeClaim
  - projected
  - secret
  priority: 0
  ```

* From the command line, you can run the setup scripts included under `pak_extensions/pre-install`
  As a cluster admin the pre-install instructions are located at:
  * `pre-install/clusterAdministration/createSecurityClusterPrereqs.sh`

  As team admin the namespace scoped instructions are located at:
  * `pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh`

## Resources Required
Kubernetes 1.9

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart into the namespace 'default', with the release name `my-ucdagent`, and reading all remaining installation values from a file named my-agent-values.yaml:

```bash
$ helm install ibm-ucda-prod-2.1.5.tgz --namespace default --name my-ucdagent -f my-agent-values.yaml --tls
```

The [configuration](#Configuration) section lists the parameters that can be set during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Verifying the Chart
Check the Resources->Agents page of the UrbanCode Deploy server UI to verify the agent has connected successfully.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-ucdagent` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete --purge my-ucdagent
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.


## Configuration
