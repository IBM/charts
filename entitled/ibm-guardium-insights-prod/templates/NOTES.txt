** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

Insights can be accessed at the following endpoint:

    {{ $.Values.global.insights.ingress.hostName }}

{{- if .Release.IsInstall }}

    To validate if the service is ready, the following command should return a result:

    oc get cm | grep tenant-postdeploy-ready
{{- end }}

{{- if .Release.IsUpgrade }}

    To validate if upgrade or rollback is complete, the following command should not return a result

    oc get po -n={{.Release.Name}} -lrelease={{.Release.Name}} | grep -v Running | grep -v cfg-job | grep -v Completed
{{- end -}}
