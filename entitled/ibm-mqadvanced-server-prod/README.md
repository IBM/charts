# IBM MQ Advanced

## Introduction

This chart deploys a single IBMÂ® MQ version 9.1.4 Advanced server (Queue Manager).  IBM MQ is messaging middleware that simplifies and accelerates the integration of diverse applications and business data across multiple platforms.  It uses message queues to facilitate the exchanges of information and offers a single messaging solution for cloud, mobile, Internet of Things (IoT) and on-premises environments.

## Chart Details

This chart will do the following:

* Create a single MQ server (Queue Manager) using a [Stateful Set](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/) with one or two replicas depending on whether multi-instance queue managers are enabled.  Kubernetes will ensure that if it fails for some reason, it will be restarted, possibly on a different worker node.
* Create a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).  This is used to ensure that MQ client applications have a consistent IP address to connect to, regardless of where the Queue Manager is actually running.
* Create an [OpenShift Route](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/architecture/networking/routes.html) for the queue manager.
* [Optional] Create additional [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) for use with a multi-instance Queue Manager.
* [Optional] Create a metrics [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) for accessing Queue Manager metrics.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.11.0 or greater, with beta APIs enabled.
* If persistence is enabled (see the **configuration** section), then you either need to create a PersistentVolume, or specify a Storage Class if classes are defined in your cluster.

### Red Hat OpenShift SecurityContextConstraints Requirements

This chart requires a SecurityContextConstraints to be bound to the target namespace prior to installation. To meet this requirement there may be cluster scoped as well as namespace scoped pre-install actions that need to occur.

The predefined SecurityContextConstraints name: [`ibm-anyuid-scc`](https://ibm.biz/cpkspec-scc) has been verified for this chart, if your target namespace is bound to this SecurityContextConstraints resource you can proceed to install the chart.

This chart also defines a custom SecurityContextConstraints which can be used to finely control the permissions/capabilities needed to deploy this chart. You can enable this custom SecurityContextConstraints resource using the supplied scripts in the `pak_extensions` pre-install directory.

  - Custom SecurityContextConstraints definition:
    ```
    apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
    kind: SecurityContextConstraints
    metadata:
      name: ibm-mq-scc
    allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
    allowHostIPC: false
    allowHostNetwork: false
    allowHostPID: false
    allowHostPorts: false
    allowPrivilegedContainer: false
    allowedCapabilities:
    - CHOWN
    - FOWNER
    - DAC_OVERRIDE
    allowedFlexVolumes: []
    defaultAddCapabilities: []
    fsGroup:
      type: RunAsAny
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
    requiredDropCapabilities:
    - MKNOD
    runAsUser:
      type: RunAsAny
    seLinuxContext:
      type: RunAsAny
    supplementalGroups:
      type: RunAsAny
    volumes:
    - secret
    - persistentVolumeClaim
    users: []
    priority: 0
    ```

- From the command line, you can run the setup scripts included under [pak_extensions](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/entitled/ibm-mqadvanced-server-prod/ibm_cloud_pak/pak_extensions)

  As a cluster admin the pre-install script is located at:
  - pre-install/clusterAdministration/createSecurityClusterPrereqs.sh

  As team admin the namespace scoped pre-install script is located at:
  - pre-install/namespaceAdministration/createSecurityNamespacePrereqs.sh

## Resources Required

This chart uses the following resources by default:

* 1 CPU core
* 1 Gi memory
* 2 Gi persistent volume.

See the **configuration** section for how to configure these values.

## Installing the Chart

Install the chart, specifying the release name (for example `foo`) and Helm repository name (for example `mylocal-repo`) with the following command:

```sh
helm install --name foo mylocal-repo/ibm-mqadvanced-server-prod --set license=accept --tls
```

This example assumes that you have a local Helm repository configured, called `mylocal-repo`.  You could alternatively reference a local directory containing the Helm chart code.

This command accepts the [IBM MQ Advanced license](http://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?la_formnum=Z125-3301-14&li_formnum=L-APIG-BGMHFW) and deploys an MQ Advanced server on the Kubernetes cluster. The **configuration** section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: See all the resources deployed by the chart using `kubectl get all -l release=foo`

### Uninstalling the Chart

You can uninstall/delete the `foo` release as follows:

```sh
helm delete foo --tls
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart, except any Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).  This is the default behavior of Kubernetes, and ensures that valuable data is not deleted.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart.

> **Tip**: You can use the default values.yaml

## Storage

The chart mounts [Persistent Volumes](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) for the storage of MQ configuration data and messages.  By using Persistent Volumes based on network-attached storage, Kubernetes can re-schedule the MQ server onto a different worker node.  You should not use "hostPath" or "local" volumes, because this will not allow moving between nodes.

Performance requirements will vary widely based on workload, but as a guideline, use a Storage Class which allows for at least 200 IOPS (based on 16 KB block size with a 50/50 read/write mix).

Deployments of multi-instance queue managers and queue managers with separate storage (for transaction logs and/or queue manager data) require that all Persistent Volumes be located in the same zone.  If you have a multi-zone cluster, and the storage provider does not replicate Persistent Volumes across failure domains (availability zones), then your cluster administrator will need to create a set of customized storage classes.

- A customized storage class will be required for each zone in which you wish to deploy an MQ instance.
- Each customized storage class should specify zone/region information as documented by your cloud provider.
- When deploying a queue manager you need to specify the storage class name for each Persistent Volume Claim. This must be set to the name of the customized storage class for your chosen zone.  For example, for a multi-instance queue manager you must set `dataPVC.storageClassName`, `logPVC.storageClassName` and `qmPVC.storageClassName`.

## Limitations

You must not manually change the number of replicas in the StatefulSet.  The number of replicas controls whether or not multi-instance queue managers are used, and are changed in conjunction with other settings.

The recommended way to scale MQ is by deploying this chart multiple times and connecting the Queue Managers together using MQ configuration, such as MQ clusters â see [Architectures based on multiple queue managers](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.pla.doc/q004720_.htm).

## Documentation

### Configuring MQ objects

You have the following major options for configuring the MQ queue manager itself:

1. Create a new image layer with your configuration baked-in
2. Configure remote administration over messaging, and use existing tools, such as `runmqsc`, MQ Explorer or the MQ Command Server.

The web console and REST administrative API are not currently supported.

#### Configuring MQ using a new image layer

You can create a new container image layer, on top of the IBM MQ Advanced base image.  You can add MQSC files to define MQ objects such as queues and topics, and place these files into `/etc/mqm` in your image.  When the MQ pod starts, it will run any MQSC files found in this directory (in sorted order).

#### Example Dockerfile and MQSC script for creating a new image

In this example you will create a Dockerfile that creates two users:

* `admin` - Administrator user which is a member of the `mqm` group
* `app` - Client application user which is a member of the `mqclient` group. (You will also create this group)

You will also create a MQSC Script file called `config.mqsc` that will be run automatically when your container starts. This script will do the following:

* Create default local queues for my applications
* Create channels for use by the `admin` and `app` users
* Configure security to allow use of the channels by remote applications
* Create authority records to allow members of the `mqclient` group to access the Queue Manager and the default local queues.

First create a file called `config.mqsc`. This the MQSC file that will be run when an MQ container starts. It should contain the following:

```
* Create Local Queues that my application(s) can use.
DEFINE QLOCAL('EXAMPLE.QUEUE.1') REPLACE
DEFINE QLOCAL('EXAMPLE.QUEUE.2') REPLACE

* Create a Dead Letter Queue for undeliverable messages and set the Queue Manager to use it.
DEFINE QLOCAL('EXAMPLE.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE') REPLACE
ALTER QMGR DEADQ('EXAMPLE.DEAD.LETTER.QUEUE')

* Set ADOPTCTX to YES so we use the same userid passed for authentication as the one for authorization and refresh the security configuration
ALTER AUTHINFO(SYSTEM.DEFAULT.AUTHINFO.IDPWOS) AUTHTYPE(IDPWOS) ADOPTCTX(YES)
REFRESH SECURITY(*) TYPE(CONNAUTH)

* Create a entry channel for the Admin user and Application user
DEFINE CHANNEL('EXAMP.ADMIN.SVRCONN') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) REPLACE
DEFINE CHANNEL('EXAMP.APP.SVRCONN') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('app') REPLACE

* Set Channel authentication rules to only allow access through the two channels we created and only allow admin users to connect through EXAMPLE.ADMIN.SVRCONN
SET CHLAUTH('*') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(NOACCESS) DESCR('Back-stop rule - Blocks everyone') ACTION(REPLACE)
SET CHLAUTH('EXAMP.APP.SVRCONN') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(CHANNEL) DESCR('Allows connection via APP channel') ACTION(REPLACE)
SET CHLAUTH('EXAMP.ADMIN.SVRCONN') TYPE(ADDRESSMAP) ADDRESS('*') USERSRC(CHANNEL) DESCR('Allows connection via ADMIN channel') ACTION(REPLACE)
SET CHLAUTH('EXAMP.ADMIN.SVRCONN') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST('nobody') DESCR('Allows admins on ADMIN channel') ACTION(REPLACE)

* Set Authority records to allow the members of the mqclient group to connect to the Queue Manager and access the Local Queues which start with "EXAMPLE."
SET AUTHREC OBJTYPE(QMGR) GROUP('mqclient') AUTHADD(CONNECT,INQ)
SET AUTHREC PROFILE('EXAMPLE.**') OBJTYPE(QUEUE) GROUP('mqclient') AUTHADD(INQ,PUT,GET,BROWSE)
```

Next create a `Dockerfile` that expands on the MQ Advanced Server image to create the users and groups. It should contain the following, replacing `<IMAGE NAME>` with the MQ image you want to use as a base:

```dockerfile
FROM <IMAGE NAME>
USER root
# Add the admin user as a member of the mqm group and set their password
RUN useradd admin -G mqm \
    && echo admin:passw0rd | chpasswd \
# Create the mqclient group
    && groupadd mqclient \
# Create the app user as a member of the mqclient group and set their password
    && useradd app -G mqclient \
    && echo app:passw0rd | chpasswd
USER mqm
# Copy the configuration script to /etc/mqm where it will be picked up automatically
COPY config.mqsc /etc/mqm/
```

Finally, build and push the image to your registry.

You can then use the new image when you deploy MQ into your cluster. You will find that once you have run the image you will be able to see your new default objects and users.

### JSON log output

By default, the MQ container output is in JSON format, to better integrate with log aggregation services.  On the command line, you can use utilities like 'jq' to format this output, for example:

```sh
kubectl logs foo-ibm-mq-0 | jq -r '.ibm_datetime + " " + .message'
```

### Supplying certificates to be used for TLS

The `pki.trust` and `pki.keys` allow you to supply details of Kubernetes secrets that contain TLS certificates. By doing so the TLS certificates will be imported into the container at runtime and MQ will be configured to use them. You can supply both certificates which contain only a public key and certificates that contain both public and private keys.

If you supply invalid files or invalid YAML objects then the container will terminate with an appropriate termination message. The next 2 sections will detail the requirements for supplying each type of certificate.

#### Supplying certificates which contain the public and private keys

When supplying a Kubernetes secret that contains a certificate files for both the public and private key you must ensure that the secret contains a file that ends in `.crt` and a file that ends in `.key` named the same. For example: `tls.crt` and `tls.key`. The extension of the file denotes whether the file is the public key (`.crt`) or the private key (`.key`) and must be correct. If your certificate has been issued by a Certificate Authority, then the certificate from the CA must be included as a seperate file with the `.crt` extension. For example: `ca.crt`.

The format of the YAML objects for `pki.keys` value is as follows:

```YAML
- name: mykey
  secret:
    secretName: mykeysecret
    items:
      - tls.key
      - tls.crt
      - ca.crt
```

or alternatively in a single line you can supply the following: `- name: mykey, secret: {secretName: mykeysecret, items: [tls.key, tls.crt, ca.crt]}`

`name` must be set to a lowercase alphanumeric value and will be used as the label for the certificate in the keystore and queue manager.

`secret.secretName` must match the name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the TLS certificates you wish to import

`secret.items` must list the TLS certificate files contained in `secret.secretName` you want to import.

To supply the YAML objects when deploying via Helm you should use the following: `--set pki.keys[0].name=mykey,pki.keys[0].secret.secretName=mykeysecret,pki.keys[0].secret.items[0]=tls.key,pki.keys[0].secret.items[1]=tls.crt,pki.keys[0].secret.items[2]=ca.crt`

If you supply multiple YAML objects then the queue manager will use the first object chosen by the label name alphabetically. For example if you supply the following labels: `alabel`, `blabel` and `clabel`. The queue manager and MQ Console will use the certificate with the label `alabel` for its identity. In this queue manager this can be changed by running the MQSC command: `ALTER QMGR CERTLABL('<new label>')`.

#### Supplying certficates which contain only the public key

When supplying a Kubernetes secret that contains a certificate file with only the public key you must ensure that the secret contains files that have the extension `.crt`. For example: `tls.crt` and `ca.crt`.

The format of the YAML objects for `pki.trust` value is as follows:

```YAML
- secret:
    secretName: mycertificate
    items:
      - tls.crt
```

or alternatively in a single line you can supply the following: `- secret: {secretName: mycertificate, items: [tls.crt]}`

`secret.secretName` must match the name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the TLS certificates you wish to add.

`secret.items` must list the TLS certificate files contained in `secret.secretName` you want to add.

To supply the YAML objects when deploying via Helm you should use the following: `--set pki.trust[0].secret.secretName=mycertificate,pki.trust[0].secret.items[0]=tls.crt`

If you supply multiple YAML objects then all of the certificates specified will be added into the queue manager and MQ Console Truststores.
