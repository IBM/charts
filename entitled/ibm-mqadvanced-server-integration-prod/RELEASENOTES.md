# Breaking Changes

- Authorization for the MQ Web Console is now controlled by IAM roles; configuring access via `sso.webAdminUsers` is no longer supported.  To access the MQ Web Console you must now either have the `administrator` role for the namespace where MQ is deployed or have the cluster-administrator role.
- The deprecated `tls.secret` configuration option has now been removed.  If you are upgrading from a previous release, and have this value set, then you must now set `pki.keys` instead.

# Whatâ€™s new in the MQ Advanced for Cloud Pak for Integration Chart, Version 6.0.x

- Updated to IBM MQ 9.1.4
- Added IAM based authorization for single sign-on to the MQ Web Console
- Added an option to enable MQ trace on the startup of the queue manager
- Added an option to modify the termination grace period
- Updated to use UBI 8 base image

# Fixes

- None

# Prerequisites

- OpenShift Container Platform v4.2 and v4.3 (Kubernetes 1.14 & 1.16)

# Documentation

- [What's new and changed in IBM MQ Version 9.1.x](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.1.0/com.ibm.mq.pro.doc/q113110_.htm)
- When upgrading from a previous version of this chart, you will experience a short outage, while the old Queue Manager container is replaced.  Client applications which are set to automatically reconnect should recover within seconds or minutes.
