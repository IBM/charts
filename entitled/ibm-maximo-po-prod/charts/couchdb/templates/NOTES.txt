Apache CouchDB is starting. Check the status of the Pods using:

  kubectl get pods --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app={{ template "couchdb.name" . }},release={{ .Release.Name }}"

Once the pod fully Ready, log in the pod and execute the following command to create
some required system databases:
   
curl -X PUT http://admin:yourpwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users
curl -X PUT http://admin:yourpwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator
curl -X PUT http://admin:yourpwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes

The yourpwd needs be queried from the secret then base64 decodes it.
Then it's time to relax.
