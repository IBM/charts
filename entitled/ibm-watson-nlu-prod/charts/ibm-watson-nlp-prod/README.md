# IBM Watson Natural Language Processing

This is a placeholder to avoid local cv lint errors.  Since this chart is a subchart of NLU, this file is not needed, but its nice to avoid the cv lint errors when running cv lint against textprocessing.

NLU Text Processing API

## Introduction

NLU Text Processing API is a stateless microservice, written in Java. API accepts a text, processes it to determine its morphological information like sentence, token, lemma, part of speech.., and returns in JSON format.

## Chart Details

This chart creates one pod and an associaged service:

- `ibm-watson-nlp-prod` - Tokenizes the incoming text.
  - Supported languages
    - English
    - Japanese
    - French
    - Portuguese
    - Italian
    - Spanish
    - German

All the requests are processed by one single service/deployment.

## Prerequisites
## Resources Required
## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release /path/to/chart
```

To verify an installation:

```bash
$ helm test my-release
```

Or with cleanup:

```bash
$ helm test --cleanup my-release
```

To delete an installation:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

Or remove the release from the store and make its name free for later use:

```bash
$ helm delete --purge my-release
```

## Configuration

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the `ibm-watson-nlp-prod` chart and their default values.
