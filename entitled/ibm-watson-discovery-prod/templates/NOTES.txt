Post helm installation steps:

1. Wait for all pods to become ready. You can keep track of the pods either through the dashboard or through the command line interface:
  kubectl get pods -l release={{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

2. (Optional) Validate health of pods by running helm tests:
  helm test {{ .Release.Name }} --tls --cleanup

3. If `helm test` was ran, the pods created from the test can be deleted with:
    kubectl delete pod <name of pod(s)>
