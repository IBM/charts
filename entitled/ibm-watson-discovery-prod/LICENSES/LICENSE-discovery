International Program License Agreement

Part 1 - General Terms

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, CLICKING ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR OTHERWISE USING THE PROGRAM, LICENSEE AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF LICENSEE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND LICENSEE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,

* DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, CLICK ON AN "ACCEPT" BUTTON, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND

* PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED MEDIA, DOCUMENTATION, AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM IT WAS OBTAINED FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT PAID. IF THE PROGRAM WAS DOWNLOADED, DESTROY ALL COPIES OF THE PROGRAM.

1. Definitions

"Authorized Use" - the specified level at which Licensee is authorized to execute or run the Program. That level may be measured by number of users, millions of service units ("MSUs"), Processor Value Units ("PVUs"), or other level of use specified by IBM.

"IBM" - International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.

"License Information" ("LI") - a document that provides information and any additional terms specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at www.ibm.com/software/sla. The LI can also be found in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet included with the Program.

"Program" - the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, files, and modules, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and 4) related licensed materials (such as keys and documentation).

"Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") - evidence of Licensee's Authorized Use. The PoE is also evidence of Licensee's eligibility for warranty, future update prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide Licensee with a PoE, then IBM may accept as the PoE the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom Licensee obtained the Program, provided that it specifies the Program name and Authorized Use obtained.

"Warranty Period" - one year, starting on the date the original Licensee is granted the license.

2. Agreement Structure

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), the LI, and the PoE and is the complete agreement between Licensee and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between Licensee and IBM concerning Licensee's use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent of any conflict, the LI prevails over both Parts.

3. License Grant

The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.

IBM grants Licensee a nonexclusive license to 1) use the Program up to the Authorized Use specified in the PoE, 2) make and install copies to support such Authorized Use, and 3) make a backup copy, all provided that

a. Licensee has lawfully obtained the Program and complies with the terms of this Agreement;

b. the backup copy does not execute unless the backed-up Program cannot execute;

c. Licensee reproduces all copyright notices and other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program;

d. Licensee ensures that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) 1) does so only on Licensee's behalf and 2) complies with the terms of this Agreement;

e. Licensee does not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as expressly permitted in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, otherwise translate, or reverse engineer the Program, except as expressly permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; 3) use any of the Program's components, files, modules, audio-visual content, or related licensed materials separately from that Program; or 4) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program; and

f. if Licensee obtains this Program as a Supporting Program, Licensee uses this Program only to support the Principal Program and subject to any limitations in the license to the Principal Program, or, if Licensee obtains this Program as a Principal Program, Licensee uses all Supporting Programs only to support this Program, and subject to any limitations in this Agreement. For purposes of this Item "f," a "Supporting Program" is a Program that is part of another IBM Program ("Principal Program") and identified as a Supporting Program in the Principal Program's LI. (To obtain a separate license to a Supporting Program without these restrictions, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained the Supporting Program.)

This license applies to each copy of the Program that Licensee makes.

3.1 Trade-ups, Updates, Fixes, and Patches

3.1.1 Trade-ups

If the Program is replaced by a trade-up Program, the replaced Program's license is promptly terminated.

3.1.2 Updates, Fixes, and Patches

When Licensee receives an update, fix, or patch to a Program, Licensee accepts any additional or different terms that are applicable to such update, fix, or patch that are specified in its LI. If no additional or different terms are provided, then the update, fix, or patch is subject solely to this Agreement. If the Program is replaced by an update, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of the replaced Program.

3.2 Fixed Term Licenses

If IBM licenses the Program for a fixed term, Licensee's license is terminated at the end of the fixed term, unless Licensee and IBM agree to renew it.

3.3 Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective until terminated.

IBM may terminate Licensee's license if Licensee fails to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee agrees to promptly discontinue use of and destroy all of Licensee's copies of the Program. Any terms of this Agreement that by their nature extend beyond termination of this Agreement remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to both parties' respective successors and assignees.

4. Charges

Charges are based on Authorized Use obtained, which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified elsewhere in this Agreement.

If Licensee wishes to increase its Authorized Use, Licensee must notify IBM or an authorized IBM reseller in advance and pay any applicable charges.

5. Taxes

If any authority imposes on the Program a duty, tax, levy, or fee, excluding those based on IBM's net income, then Licensee agrees to pay that amount, as specified in an invoice, or supply exemption documentation. Licensee is responsible for any personal property taxes for the Program from the date that Licensee obtains it. If any authority imposes a customs duty, tax, levy, or fee for the import into or the export, transfer, access, or use of the Program outside the country in which the original Licensee was granted the license, then Licensee agrees that it is responsible for, and will pay, any amount imposed.

6. Money-back Guarantee

If Licensee is dissatisfied with the Program for any reason and is the original Licensee, Licensee may terminate the license and obtain a refund of the amount Licensee paid for the Program, provided that Licensee returns the Program and PoE to the party from whom Licensee obtained it within 30 days of the date the PoE was issued to Licensee. If the license is for a fixed term that is subject to renewal, then Licensee may obtain a refund only if the Program and its PoE are returned within the first 30 days of the initial term. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

7. Program Transfer

Licensee may transfer the Program and all of Licensee's license rights and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the license is terminated for any reason by either party, Licensee is prohibited from transferring the Program to another party. Licensee may not transfer a portion of 1) the Program or 2) the Program's Authorized Use. When Licensee transfers the Program, Licensee must also transfer a hard copy of this Agreement, including the LI and PoE. Immediately after the transfer, Licensee's license terminates.

8. Warranty and Exclusions

8.1 Limited Warranty

IBM warrants that the Program, when used in its specified operating environment, will conform to its specifications. The Program's specifications, and specified operating environment information, can be found in documentation accompanying the Program (such as a read-me file) or other information published by IBM (such as an announcement letter). Licensee agrees that such documentation and other Program content may be supplied only in the English language, unless otherwise required by local law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation.

The warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Program, or that IBM will correct all Program defects. Licensee is responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program.

During the Warranty Period, IBM provides Licensee with access to IBM databases containing information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software Support Handbook for further information at www.ibm.com/software/support.

If the Program does not function as warranted during the Warranty Period and the problem cannot be resolved with information available in the IBM databases, Licensee may return the Program and its PoE to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom Licensee obtained it and receive a refund of the amount Licensee paid. After returning the Program, Licensee's license terminates. If Licensee downloaded the Program, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee obtained it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.

8.2 Exclusions

THESE WARRANTIES ARE LICENSEE'S EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE. IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO LICENSEE.

THESE WARRANTIES GIVE LICENSEE SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. LICENSEE MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

THE WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 8 (WARRANTY AND EXCLUSIONS) ARE PROVIDED SOLELY BY IBM. THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SUBSECTION 8.2 (EXCLUSIONS), HOWEVER, ALSO APPLY TO IBM'S SUPPLIERS OF THIRD PARTY CODE. THOSE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE SUCH CODE WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT NULLIFY IBM'S WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

9. Licensee Data and Databases

To assist Licensee in isolating the cause of a problem with the Program, IBM may request that Licensee 1) allow IBM to remotely access Licensee's system or 2) send Licensee information or system data to IBM. However, IBM is not obligated to provide such assistance unless IBM and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which IBM agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which is beyond IBM's warranty obligations in this Agreement. In any event, IBM uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings. For these purposes, IBM may use IBM entities and subcontractors (including in one or more countries other than the one in which Licensee is located), and Licensee authorizes IBM to do so.

Licensee remains responsible for 1) any data and the content of any database Licensee makes available to IBM, 2) the selection and implementation of procedures and controls regarding access, security, encryption, use, and transmission of data (including any personally-identifiable data), and 3) backup and recovery of any database and any stored data. Licensee will not send or provide IBM access to any personally-identifiable information, whether in data or any other form, and will be responsible for reasonable costs and other amounts that IBM may incur relating to any such information mistakenly provided to IBM or the loss or disclosure of such information by IBM, including those arising out of any third party claims.

10. Limitation of Liability

The limitations and exclusions in this Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) apply to the full extent they are not prohibited by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver.

10.1 Items for Which IBM May Be Liable

Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on IBM's part or other liability, Licensee is entitled to recover damages from IBM. Regardless of the basis on which Licensee is entitled to claim damages from IBM (including fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or tort claim), IBM's entire liability for all claims in the aggregate arising from or related to each Program or otherwise arising under this Agreement will not exceed the amount of any 1) damages for bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and tangible personal property and 2) other actual direct damages up to the charges (if the Program is subject to fixed term charges, up to twelve months' charges) Licensee paid for the Program that is the subject of the claim.

This limit also applies to any of IBM's Program developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which IBM and its Program developers and suppliers are collectively responsible.

10.2 Items for Which IBM Is Not Liable

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY:

a. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;

b. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR

c. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.

11. Compliance Verification

For purposes of this Section 11 (Compliance Verification), "IPLA Program Terms" means 1) this Agreement and applicable amendments and transaction documents provided by IBM, and 2) IBM software policies that may be found at the IBM Software Policy website (www.ibm.com/softwarepolicies), including but not limited to those policies concerning backup, sub-capacity pricing, and migration.

The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 11 remain in effect during the period the Program is licensed to Licensee, and for two years thereafter.

11.1 Verification Process

Licensee agrees to create, retain, and provide to IBM and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system information sufficient to provide auditable verification that Licensee's use of all Programs is in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms, including, without limitation, all of IBM's applicable licensing and pricing qualification terms. Licensee is responsible for 1) ensuring that it does not exceed its Authorized Use, and 2) remaining in compliance with IPLA Program Terms.


Upon reasonable notice, IBM may verify Licensee's compliance with IPLA Program Terms at all sites and for all environments in which Licensee uses (for any purpose) Programs subject to IPLA Program Terms. Such verification will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to Licensee's business, and may be conducted on Licensee's premises, during normal business hours. IBM may use an independent auditor to assist with such verification, provided IBM has a written confidentiality agreement in place with such auditor.

11.2 Resolution

IBM will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used any Program in excess of its Authorized Use or is otherwise not in compliance with the IPLA Program Terms. Licensee agrees to promptly pay directly to IBM the charges that IBM specifies in an invoice for 1) any such excess use, 2) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or two years, and 3) any additional charges and other liabilities determined as a result of such verification.

12. Third Party Notices

The Program may include third party code that IBM, not the third party, licenses to Licensee under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party code ("Third Party Notices") are included for Licensee's information only. These notices can be found in the Program's NOTICES file(s). Information on how to obtain source code for certain third party code can be found in the Third Party Notices. If in the Third Party Notices IBM identifies third party code as "Modifiable Third Party Code," IBM authorizes Licensee to 1) modify the Modifiable Third Party Code and 2) reverse engineer the Program modules that directly interface with the Modifiable Third Party Code provided that it is only for the purpose of debugging Licensee's modifications to such third party code. IBM's service and support obligations, if any, apply only to the unmodified Program.

13. General

a. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.

b. For Programs IBM provides to Licensee in tangible form, IBM fulfills its shipping and delivery obligations upon the delivery of such Programs to the IBM-designated carrier, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Licensee and IBM.

c. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

d. Licensee agrees to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including U.S. embargo and sanctions regulations and prohibitions on export for certain end uses or to certain users.

e. Licensee authorizes International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (and their successors and assigns, contractors and IBM Business Partners) to store and use Licensee's business contact information wherever they do business, in connection with IBM products and services, or in furtherance of IBM's business relationship with Licensee.

f. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims that the other has not met its obligations under this Agreement. The parties will attempt in good faith to resolve all disputes, disagreements, or claims between the parties relating to this Agreement.

g. Unless otherwise required by applicable law without the possibility of contractual waiver or limitation: 1) neither party will bring a legal action, regardless of form, for any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose; and 2) upon the expiration of such time limit, any such claim and all respective rights related to the claim lapse.

h. Neither Licensee nor IBM is responsible for failure to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.

i. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by this Agreement, nor is IBM responsible for any third party claims against Licensee, except as permitted in Subsection 10.1 (Items for Which IBM May Be Liable) above for bodily injury (including death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which IBM is legally liable to that third party.

j. In entering into this Agreement, neither party is relying on any representation not specified in this Agreement, including but not limited to any representation concerning: 1) the performance or function of the Program, other than as expressly warranted in Section 8 (Warranty and Exclusions) above; 2) the experiences or recommendations of other parties; or 3) any results or savings that Licensee may achieve.

k. IBM has signed agreements with certain organizations (called "IBM Business Partners") to promote, market, and support certain Programs. IBM Business Partners remain independent and separate from IBM. IBM is not responsible for the actions or statements of IBM Business Partners or obligations they have to Licensee.

l. The license and intellectual property indemnification terms of Licensee's other agreements with IBM (such as the IBM Customer Agreement) do not apply to Program licenses granted under this Agreement.

14. Geographic Scope and Governing Law

14.1 Governing Law

Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country in which Licensee obtained the Program license to govern, interpret, and enforce all of Licensee's and IBM's respective rights, duties, and obligations arising from, or relating in any manner to, the subject matter of this Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles.

The following standard terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Limited use right

As described in the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") and this License Information, IBM grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program. Additional rights may be available to Licensee subject to the payment of additional fees or under different or supplementary terms. IBM reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Specifications

Program's specifications can be found in the collective Description and Technical Information sections of the Program's Announcement Letters.

Prohibited Uses

Licensee may not use or authorize others to use the Program if failure of the Program could lead to death, bodily injury, or property or environmental damage.

Supporting Programs

Licensee is authorized to install and use the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement. The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would only include those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements to the Program, as a whole, to cover Licensee's installation and use of all of the Supporting Programs, unless separate entitlements are provided within this License Information document. For example, if this Program were licensed on a PVU (Processor Value Unit) basis and Licensee were to install the Principal Program or a Supporting Program on a 100 PVU machine (physical or virtual) and another Supporting Program on a second 100 PVU machine, Licensee would be required to obtain 200 PVU entitlements to the Program.

Supporting Programs:
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Enterprise Edition 2.1.0.1
IBM Cloud Pak for Data Enterprise Edition 2.1.0.2
Watson Knowledge Studio 1.0.1

Such additional Separately Licensed Code and related licenses are listed in another NON_IBM_LICENSE file that accompanies the Program update or fix. Licensee acknowledges that Licensee has read and agrees to the license agreements contained in the NON_IBM_LICENSE file(s). If Licensee does not agree to the terms of these third party license agreements, Licensee may not use the Separately Licensed Code.

For Programs acquired under the International Program License Agreement ("IPLA") or International Program License Agreement for Non Warranted Program ("ILAN") and Licensee is the original licensee of the Program, if Licensee does not agree with the third party license agreements, Licensee may return the Program in accordance with the terms of, and within the specified time frames stated in, the "Money-back Guarantee" section of the IPLA or ILAN IBM Agreement.

Note: Notwithstanding any of the terms in the third party license agreement, the Agreement, or any other agreement Licensee may have with IBM:
(a) IBM provides this Separately Licensed Code to Licensee WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND;
(b) IBM DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SEPARATELY LICENSED CODE;
(c) IBM is not liable to Licensee, and will not defend, indemnify, or hold Licensee harmless for any claims arising from or related to the Separately Licensed Code; and
(d) IBM is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages including, but not limited to, lost data, lost savings, and lost profits, with respect to the Separately Licensed Code.

Source Components and Sample Materials

The Program may include some components in source code form ("Source Components") and other materials identified as Sample Materials. Licensee may copy and modify Source Components and Sample Materials for internal use only provided such use is within the limits of the license rights under this Agreement, provided however that Licensee may not alter or delete any copyright information or notices contained in the Source Components or Sample Materials. IBM provides the Source Components and Sample Materials without obligation of support and "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR NON-INTERFERENCE AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Export and Import Restrictions

This Program may contain cryptography. Transfer to, or use by, users of the Program may be prohibited or subject to export or import laws, regulations or policies, including those of the United States Export Administration Regulations. Licensee assumes all responsibility for complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies regarding the export, import, or use of this Program, including but not limited to, U.S. restrictions on exports or reexports. To obtain the export classification of this Program refer to: https://www.ibm.com/products/exporting/.

The following units of measure may apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Resource Value Unit (RVU)

Resource Value Unit (RVU) is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. RVU Proofs of Entitlement are based on the number of units of a specific resource used or managed by the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient entitlements for the number of RVUs required for Licensee's environment for the specific resources as specified in the table below. RVU entitlements are specific to the Program and the type of resource and may not be exchanged, interchanged, or aggregated with RVU entitlements of another program or resource.

Virtual Processor Core

Virtual Processor Core is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. A Server is a physical computer that is comprised of processing units, memory, and input/output capabilities and that executes requested procedures, commands, or applications for one or more users or client devices. Where racks, blade enclosures, or other similar equipment is being employed, each separable physical device (for example, a blade or a rack-mounted device) that has the required components is considered itself a separate Server. A Virtual Server is either a virtual computer created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. A Processor Core is a functional unit within a computing device that interprets and executes instructions. A Processor Core consists of at least an instruction control unit and one or more arithmetic or logic unit. A Virtual Processor Core is a Processor Core on a Virtual Server created by partitioning the resources available to a physical Server or an unpartitioned physical Server. Licensee must obtain entitlement for each Virtual Processor Core made available to the Program.

In addition to the above, the following terms apply to Licensee's use of the Program.

Cumulative Entitlements

Virtual Processor Core and Resource Value Unit entitlements are not alternative means for licensing the Program. Licensee must obtain sufficient Virtual Processor Core entitlements for the relevant servers being used by the Program, as well as a sufficient number of Resource Value Unit entitlements for the Resources stored in the Program. 

Resource Value Unit 

The Resource for the purpose of RVU calculation is One Hundred Thousand Documents. A Document is a finite volume of data that is enveloped within a document header and trailer record that marks its beginning and end or any electronic representation of a physical document. Sufficient entitlements must be obtained to cover the total number of Documents stored in the Program at any time.

Resource Value Unit Conversion Table

From 1 to 5 Resources, 1.00 RVU per Resource
From 6 to 25 Resources, 5 RVUs plus 0.45 RVUs per Resource above 5
From 26 to 50 Resources, 14 RVUs plus 0.35 RVUs per Resource above 25
From 51 to 100 Resources, 22.75 RVUs plus 0.08 RVUs per Resource above 50
From 101 to 500 Resources, 26.75 RVUs plus 0.04 RVUs per Resource above 100
For more than 500 Resources, 42.75 RVUs plus 0.02 RVUs per Resource above 500 


1. Development and Functional Testing

When determining the number of entitlements required for Licensee's installation or use of the Program, installation or use for Development and Functional Testing is not taken into consideration on up to three (3) Installs and up to the equivalent number of VPC entitlements obtained to the Program. In other words, Licensee may install and use the Program for Development and Functional Testing under the license terms, but such use is not used to determine the number of entitlements required for the Program.


An Install is an installed copy of the Program on a physical or virtual disk made available to be executed on a computer. 

"Development and Functional Testing" means that the Program can only be deployed as part of Licensee's internal development, unit, and functional testing environments. Licensee is not authorized to use the Program for processing production workloads, simulating production workloads or testing scalability of any code, application or system. Licensee is not authorized to use any part of the Program for any other purposes without acquiring the appropriate production entitlements.

2. The Program, including but not limited to components, files, modules, audio-visual content or related licensed materials, as well as models, algorithms or data provided with the Program (collectively "Licensed Materials"), are IBM confidential information. Licensee agrees to hold the Licensed Materials in trust and confidence for IBM and shall preserve the confidentiality of the Licensed Materials. Licensee agrees that any threatened or actual violation of this confidentiality provision will cause irreparable injury to IBM, and IBM will be entitled to any legal or equitable remedies necessary to make it whole including any preservation measures or necessary injunctive relief that can be provided by an applicable authority capable of granting such measures or relief.

Licensee has implemented and will maintain throughout the term of this Agreement the network, platform, system, application, device, physical infrastructure, incident response, and personnel focused security policies, procedures, and controls that are necessary to protect the Licensed Materials against loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized access, and unlawful forms of processing. Licensee will promptly (and in no event any later than 24 hours) notify IBM after becoming aware of any breach or other security incident that Licensee knows, or should reasonably suspect, affects or will affect the Licensed Materials or IBM, and will timely provide information that IBM requests about such security incident and the status of any Licensee remediation and restoration activities.

Licensee will not permit the Licensed Materials to reside on servers located outside of the country in which IBM has made the Licensed Materials available to Licensee.

   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

4. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone 
  Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database 
  is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone 
  Database section 7.

  7.  Database Ownership

    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
    document. Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the 
    public domain. Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not 
    apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to 
    it. Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ 
    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations 
    defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the 
    IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent 
    court orders. No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF 
    Trust on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution
    to the database or code waives all rights to future claims in that
    contribution or in the TZ Database.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                       Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are 
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
make sure the software is free for all its users. 

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free 
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use 
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this 
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to 
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not 
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you 
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for 
this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if 
you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in 
new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these 
things. 

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you 
if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. 

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or 
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. 
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete 
object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the 
library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you 
must show them these terms so they know their rights. 

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. 

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is 
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by 
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they 
have is not the original version, so that the original author's 
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by 
others. 

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any 
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively 
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license 
from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license 
obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full 
freedom of use specified in this license. 

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary 
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public 
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different 
from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for 
certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into 
non-free programs. 

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a 
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire 
combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public 
License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the 
library. 

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does 
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public 
License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an 
advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the 
reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. 
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special 
circumstances. 

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be 
allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library 
does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there 
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so 
we use the Lesser General Public License. 

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free 
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free 
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, 
as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. 

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked 
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program 
using a modified version of the Library. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The 
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR 
COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other 
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other 
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 
Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each 
licensee is addressed as "you". 

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data 
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. 

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which 
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" 
means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: 
that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into 
another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without 
limitation in the term "modification".) 

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the 
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and 
installation of the library. 

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a 
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the 
Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing 
it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the 
program that uses the Library does. 

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete 
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you 
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate 
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices 
that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and 
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. 

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 


2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute 
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that you also meet all of these conditions: 

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge 
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses 
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility 
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure 
       that, in the event an application does not supply such function 
       or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part 
       of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 
      a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 
      application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
      application-supplied function or table used by this function must 
      be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 
      root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and 
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 
the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
collective works based on the Library. 

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a 
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
scope of this License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do 
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that 
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, 
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the 
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify 
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these 
notices. 

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that 
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. 

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the 
Library into a program that is not a library. 

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative 
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the 
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the 
complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be 
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange. 

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a 
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source 
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the 
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the 
source along with the object code. 

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, 
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked 
with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in 
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls 
outside the scope of this License. 

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates 
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains 
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". 
The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states 
terms for distribution of such executables. 

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file 
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked 
without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold 
for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure 
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten 
lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is 
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. 
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library 
will still fall under Section 6.) 

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether 
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a 
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work 
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms 
of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work 
for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
modifications. 

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during 
execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright 
notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the 
user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: 


    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified 
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood 
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in 
       the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
       application to use the modified definitions.)
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a 
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer 
       system, rather than copying library functions into the 
       executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version 
       of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
       version is interface-compatible with the version that the work 
       was made with.
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three 
       years, to give the same user the materials specified in 
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
       performing this distribution.
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy 
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the 
       above specified materials from the same place.
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" 
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the 
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be 
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in 
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, 
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
unless that component itself accompanies the executable. 

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions 
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the 
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them 
and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library 
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities 
not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, 
provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library 
and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided 
that you do these two things: 

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based 
       on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. 
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that 
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where 
       to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the 
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this 
License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you 
under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as 
such parties remain in full compliance. 

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all 
its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Library or works based on it. 

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License. 

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would 
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who 
receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
distribution of the Library. 

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 
apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 
circumstances. 

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented 
by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to 
the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice. 

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
a consequence of the rest of this License. 

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may 
add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
limitation as if written in the body of this License. 

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions 
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new 
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may 
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any 
later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license 
version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free 
Software Foundation. 

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software 
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be 
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives 
of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software 
generally. 

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE 
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH 
YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL 
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR 
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY 
(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED 
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR 
OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 


Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this 
license document, but changing it is not allowed. 

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software 
and other kinds of works. 

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to 
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the 
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free 
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the 
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to 
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to 
your programs, too. 

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if 
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, 
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things. 

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these 
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have 
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if 
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. 

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that 
you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the 
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their 
rights. 

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) 
assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. 

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains 
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and 
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as 
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to 
authors of previous versions. 

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run 
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting 
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such 
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is 
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed 
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If 
such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to 
extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as 
needed to protect the freedom of users. 

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to 
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could 
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that 
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. 

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow. 


TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds 
of works, such as semiconductor masks. 

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this 
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and 
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations. 

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the 
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making 
of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" 
of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. 

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based 
on the Program. 

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without 
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for 
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a 
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, 
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the 
public, and in some countries other activities as well. 

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other 
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through 
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. 

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" 
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible 
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells 
the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent 
that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under 
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface 
presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent 
item in the list meets this criterion. 

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work 
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source 
form of a work. 

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language. 

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other 
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of 
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major 
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major 
Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an 
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A 
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential 
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating 
system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to 
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. 

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all 
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable 
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to 
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System 
Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs 
which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are 
not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes 
interface definition files associated with source files for the work, 
and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked 
subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as 
by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms 
and other parts of the work. 

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can 
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. 

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same 
work. 


2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of 
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated 
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited 
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a 
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its 
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your 
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. 

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, 
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. 
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having 
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with 
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the 
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not 
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for 
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and 
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your 
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. 

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the 
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes 
it unnecessary. 

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological 
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 
of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar 
laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. 

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid 
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention 
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the 
covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or 
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's 
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of 
technological measures. 

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you 
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep 
intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive 
terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all 
notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy 
of this License along with the Program. 

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and 
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to 
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms 
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 


 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, 
    and giving a relevant date. 
 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released 
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This 
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
    all notices". 

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to 
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such 
    permission if you have separately received it. 

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display 
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive 
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so. 

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent 
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and 
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or 
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not 
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users 
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in 
an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of 
the aggregate. 

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of 
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable 
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these 
ways: 

 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the 
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange. 

 b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product 
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for 
    as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
    product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code 
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the 
    software in the product that is covered by this License, on a 
    durable physical medium customarily used for software 
    interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
    physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. 

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the 
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with 
    subsection 6b. 

 d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place 
    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the 
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no 
    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the 
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) 
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the 
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is 
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. 

 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you 
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under 
    subsection 6d. 

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded 
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included 
in conveying the object code work. 

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, 
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for 
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a 
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. 
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally 
used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, 
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which 
the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the 
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the 
product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, 
unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the 
product. 

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, 
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install 
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product 
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information 
must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified 
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because 
modification has been made. 

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or 
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as 
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the 
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a 
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the 
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by 
the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if 
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified 
object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been 
installed in ROM). 

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a 
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates 
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for 
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a 
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and 
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and 
protocols for communication across the network. 

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in 
accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented 
(and with an implementation available to the public in source code 
form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, 
reading or copying. 

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this 
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. 
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall 
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent 
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions 
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately 
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this 
License without regard to the additional permissions. 

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove 
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. 
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in 
certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional 
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you 
have or can give appropriate copyright permission. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you 
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders 
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: 

 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the 
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or 

 b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or 
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or 

 c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or 
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in 
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or 

 d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or 
    authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under
    trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service
    marks; or 

 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material 
    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it)
    with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors. 

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further 
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you 
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is 
governed by this License along with a term that is a further 
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a 
further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this 
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of 
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not 
survive such relicensing or conveying. 

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must 
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms 
that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the 
applicable terms. 

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the 
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above 
requirements apply either way. 

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly 
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or 
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under 
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third 
paragraph of section 11). 

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license 
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, 
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates 
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to 
notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days 
after the cessation. 

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated 
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by 
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice 
of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, 
and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the 
notice. 

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the 
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under 
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently 
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same 
material under section 10. 

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a 
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring 
solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a 
copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than 
this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered 
work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you 
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically 
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and 
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible 
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an 
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an 
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work 
results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who 
receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work 
the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous 
paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the 
work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can 
get it with reasonable efforts. 

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the 
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not 
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights 
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any 
patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, 
or importing the Program or any portion of it. 

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this 
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work 
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version". 

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims 
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or 
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by 
this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but 
do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of 
further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this 
definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses 
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. 

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free 
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, 
use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and 
propagate the contents of its contributor version. 

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express 
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent 
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to 
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a 
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a 
patent against the party. 

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and 
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to 
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a 
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, 
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so 
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the 
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner 
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent 
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have 
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the 
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work 
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that 
country that you have reason to believe are valid. 

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or 
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a 
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties 
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or 
convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you 
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work 
and works based on it. 

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within 
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned 
on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically 
granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are 
a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of 
distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party 
based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under 
which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive 
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in 
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies 
made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with 
specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless 
you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, 
prior to 28 March 2007. 

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any 
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be 
available to you under applicable patent law. 

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a 
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that 
obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to 
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those 
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the 
Program. 

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission 
to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 
of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, 
and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will 
continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special 
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, 
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination 
as such. 

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of 
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will 
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to 
address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program 
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public 
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of 
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public 
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software 
Foundation. 

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions 
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public 
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to 
choose that version for the Program. 

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. 
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or 
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT 
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF 
THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR 
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above 
cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing 
courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute 
waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a 
warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in 
return for a fee.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

IJG JPEG Library

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is
provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its
quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights
Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed,
then this README file must be included, with this copyright and
no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes
to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the
work of the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought
to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or
products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the
Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability
claims are assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of
Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free
Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if
you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)
However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated
from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing
paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is
copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free
JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no
patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to
produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are
readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that 
"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
CompuServe Incorporated."

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

"Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or
artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
purpose of this License.
"Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
Section 1(g) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
defined above) for the purposes of this License.
"Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
transfer of ownership.
"License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.
"Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
"Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if
no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
organization that transmits the broadcast.
"Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
of this License including without limitation any production in the
literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;
a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent
it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
"You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
"Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
"Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
Collections;
to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
Collections; and,
to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.
You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i) the
terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You
must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every
copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of
the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
Applicable License.
You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above
in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange
of copyrighted works.
If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing
scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to
collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or
use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any
statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,

derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License

ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.

from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
survive any termination of this License.
Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
stated above.
8. Miscellaneous

Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
enforceable.
No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
license of any rights under applicable law.

or ownership rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer,
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all
distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

Numerical Recipes

Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User License

The following license terms and the Disclaimer of Warranty, below, apply to 
individual purchases of the Numerical Recipes Code download product, and to 
purchases of the Numerical Recipes Code CD-ROM.
By purchasing this disk or code download, you acquire a Numerical Recipes 
Personal Single-User License. This license lets you personally use Numerical 
Recipes code ("the code") on any number of computers, but only one computer 
at a time. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to access or use the code. 
You may, under this license, transfer precompiled, executable applications 
incorporating the code to other, unlicensed, persons, providing that (i) the 
application is noncommercial (e.g., does not involve the selling or licensing 
of the application for a fee or its use in developing commercial products or 
services), and (ii) the application was first developed, compiled, and successfully 
run by you, and (iii) the code is bound into the application in such a manner that 
it cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably be unbound and 
used in other programs. That is, under this license, your application user must not 
be able to use Numerical Recipes code as part of a program library or "mix and match" 
workbench.

Businesses and organizations that purchase this disk or code download, and that thus 
acquire one or more Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User Licenses, may permanently 
assign those licenses, in the number acquired, to individual employees. Such an assignment 
must be made before the code is first used and, once made, it is irrevocable and can not be 
transferred. In many cases, business and organizations may instead wish to purchase Numerical 
Recipes institutional subscriptions (see below), which have more flexibility.

Numerical Recipes Institutional Subscriber License
The following license terms and the Disclaimer of Warranty, below, apply to purchases of 
the Numerical Recipes institutional subscriptions.
1. By purchasing an institutional subscription you acquire a Numerical Recipes Institutional 
Subscriber License, as here described, valid for the term of your subscription. This 
license lets any number of users make unlimited use of Numerical Recipes code ("the code") 
on computers whose IP addresses are within the fixed block of addresses ("the block") 
specified at the time that the subscription was purchased, or as later amended by mutual 
agreement between you and Numerical Recipes Software (such amendment normally to be 
without cost). In acquiring this license, you warrant that you will not make use of Network 
Address Translation, Proxying, or any other technology, to allow the code to be accessible 
on a number of addresses greater than the number of IP addresses in the licensed block, 
except as provided for by a separate written agreement between you and Numerical Recipes Software.

2. In addition to the license granted by paragraph 1, you may, under this license, transfer 
precompiled, executable applications incorporating the code to other, unlicensed, machines 
or persons, providing that (i) the application was developed, compiled, and successfully run 
entirely on licensed computers within the block, and (ii) the code is bound into the 
application in such a manner that it cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot 
practicably be unbound and used in other programs. That is, for the terms of this paragraph 
to apply, your application's user must not be able to use the Numerical Recipes code as part 
of a program library, or a "mix and match" workbench, or an integrated development environment 
or programming language.

3. At the end of your subscription, your right to use the code under the terms of paragraph 
1 above shall expire, and you shall destroy all copies of Numerical Recipes code in your possession. 
Already-compiled applications that have previously qualified under paragraph 2 above shall continue 
to be licensed for use of the incorporated code in perpetuity. However, such applications may not 
be recompiled from Numerical Recipes code unless you purchase a new institutional subscription. 
(In practice, this means that you must maintain your subscription during the active life of your 
application, but may allow it to lapse when you are no longer maintaining your application.)

Disclaimer of Warranty
We make no warranties, express or implied, that the programs contained in this volume are 
free of error, or are consistent with any particular standard of merchantability, or that 
they will meet your requirements for any particular application. They should not be relied 
on for solving a problem whose incorrect solution could result in injury to a person or loss 
of property. If you do use the programs in such a manner, it is at your own risk. The authors 
and publisher disclaim all liability for direct or consequential damages resulting from your 
use of the programs.

TWAIN

The TWAIN Working Group grants customer ("Customer") the worldwide,
   royalty-free, non-exclusive license to reproduce and distribute the
  software and documentation of the TWAIN toolkit ("TWAIN Toolkit"). The
   TWAIN Toolkit was designed to be used by third parties to assist them
   in becoming compliant with the TWAIN standard, but it has not been
   developed to the standards of a commercial product. Consequently, the
 TWAIN toolkit is provided AS IS without any warranty. THE TWAIN Working
   Group disclaims all warranties in the TWAIN toolkit whether implied,
   express or statutory, including, without limitation, the implied
   warranties of merchantability, non infringement of third party rights
 and fitness for a particular purpose. The TWAIN Working Group disclaims
   all liability for damages, whether direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential, arising from the reproduction,
   distribution, modification, or other use of the TWAIN Toolkit.

  As a condition of this license, Customer agrees to include in software
   programs based in whole or in part on the TWAIN Toolkit the following
  provisions in (i) the header or similar file in such software and (ii)
   prominently in its documentation and to require its sublicensees to
   include these provisions in similar locations: The TWAIN Toolkit is
  distributed as is. The developer and distributors of the TWAIN Toolkit
   expressly disclaim all implied, express or statutory warranties
   including, without limitation, the implied warranties of
 merchantability, non infringement of third party rights and fitness for
  a particular purpose. Neither the developers nor the distributors will

UbuntuFont

UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
-------------------------------

PREAMBLE
This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
the fonts.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
as received under this licence.

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
a new environment.

"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
copyright ownership of the Font Software.

"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.

To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
countries other activities as well.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
rights are reserved.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
the below conditions:

1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
fields can be easily viewed by the user.

2) The font name complies with the following:
(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
the new work, appended to that name.

3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
their explicit written permission.

4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
licence.

TERMINATION
This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF
COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

				AUTHOR

David H. Munro wrote Yorick and Gist.  Berkeley Yacc (byacc) generated
the Yorick parser.  The routines in Math are from LAPACK and FFTPACK;
MathC contains C translations by David H. Munro.  The algorithms for
Yorick's random number generator and several special functions in
Yorick/include were taken from Numerical Recipes by Press, et. al.,
although the Yorick implementations are unrelated to those in
Numerical Recipes.  A small amount of code in Gist was adapted from
the X11R4 release, copyright M.I.T. -- the complete copyright notice
may be found in the (unused) file Gist/host.c.

   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

PYTHON 2.5 [test-unit]

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS

"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting - in part or in whole - any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
PERMISSION & CONDITIONS

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as

Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
PREAMBLE

The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
