                The type of baas request. The following types are supported and are case-insensitive:

                Backup - Schedule a backup operation for a PVC.

                Restore - Restore a PVC from a snapshot backup or a copy backup.

                Destroy - Delete all snapshot and copy backups and mark the scheduled job as destroyed.

                OnDemandBackup - Request an immediate snapshot backup of the PVC.

                BackupNamespace - Schedule a backup operation for PVCs in the specified namespace.

                BackupLabel - Schedule a backup operation for PVCs with the specified label.

              pattern: ^(?i)(BACKUP|RESTORE|DESTROY|ONDEMANDBACKUP|BACKUPNAMESPACE|BACKUPLABEL)$

            sla:
              type: array
              description:  >
                The name of the service level agreement (SLA) policy that determines the schedule for backup operations.

                Used for BACKUP and ONDEMANDBACKUP request types.

                To show the available SLA policies, enter the following command

                kubectl describe configmap baas-sla -n baas

                If an SLA policy has not been created by the storage administrator, the output will be empty.

            volumesnapshotclass:
              type: string
              description: >
                The snapshot class for snapshot backups. If you do not specify the snapshot class, the default snapshot

                class is used if the snapshotter in the default snapshot class matches the provisioner of the volume.

                Otherwise, the backup request is invalid.


            pvcname:
              type: string
              description: The name of the PVC. Used for the ONDEMANDBACKUP and RESTORE request types.

            targetvolume:
              type: string
              description: >
                The name of the PVC that you want to restore the volume to. Used for the Restore request type.

                For fast restores, the volume is always restored to a new PVC. In this case, provide the name of the new PVC.

                For copy restores, you can restore the volume to the original or new PVC. If you are restoring a copy backup to a new persistent

                volume, the PVC for the new volume is automatically created when you restore the copy backup. Except for the original location,

                the restore fails if you specify a PVC that already exists.

            restorepoint:
              type: string
              description: >
                The time stamp of the source snapshot or copy backup that you want to restore from. The time stamp is in

                Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. If you do not specify a time stamp, the most recent snapshot or copy backup is restored.

                Used for the RESTORE request type.

            restoretype:
              type: string
              description: >
                The type of restore operation to use. The following types are supported and are case-insensitive:

                Fast - Restores a volume from a snapshot backup.

                Copy - Restores a volume from a copy backup.

              pattern: ^(?i)(FAST|COPY)$
