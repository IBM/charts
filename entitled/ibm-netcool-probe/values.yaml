# Docker image license acceptance. Must be set to "accept" to start the probes.
license: "not accepted"

image:
  # Update repository to pull from private image repository. Image name must be "netcool-probe-messagebus".
  repository: "netcool-probe-messagebus"
  tag: '10.0.5.0-amd64'
  # Update test repository to pull from private image repository. Test image name must be "netcool-integration-util".

  image:
    # Image Pull Secret Name. Should be set if the Service Account is not configured with an image pull secret for the
    # specified image repository.
    secretName: ""
  # If the Cluster Administrator has already created a service account in the namespace, specify the name of the service account here.
  # If left blank, the chart will automatically create a new service account in the namespace when it is deployed. This new service account will be 
  # removed from the namespace when the chart is removed.
  serviceAccountName: ""

netcool:
  # The connection mode to use when connecting to the Netcool/OMNIbus Object Server.
  # Available options for connectionMode:
  # "Default"     - No authentication and no SSL enabled. This is the default.
  # "AuthOnly"    - Authentication enabled only. Object server must be run in secured mode. A secret 
  #                 containing "AuthUserName", "AuthPassword" and "encryption.keyfile" is required.
  # "SSLOnly"     - SSL enabled connection only. Object server must be configured with SSL certificates (AES_FIPS)
  #                 and a secret containing the "omni.kdb" and "omni.sth" is required.
  # "SSLAndAuth"  - SSL and Authentication are enabled. Object server must be run in secured mode and
  #                 SSL certificates configured (AES_FIPS). A secret containing "omni.kdb", "omni.sth", "encryption.keyfile",
  #                 "AuthUserName" and "AuthPassword" required.
  # Note: These connection modes are supported when connecting to your on-premise Object Server.
  #       For Netcool Operations Insight on ICP, you may enable IPSec to secure cluster network communications.
  connectionMode: "default"
  # (Required) Object Server Name that the probe should connect to. (Usually set to NCOMS or AGG_P)
  primaryServer: ""
  # (Required) Hostname or IP address of the primary Object Server
  primaryHost: ""
  # (Required) Object Server Port, usually set to 4100
  primaryPort:
  # Backup Object Server Name that the probe should connect to. (Usually set to AGG_B)
  backupServer: ""
  # Hostname or IP address of the backup Object Server
  backupHost: ""
  # Backup Object Server Port
  backupPort:
  # A pre-created secret for AuthOnly, SSLOnly or SSLAndAuth connection mode.
  # Certain fields are required depending on the connection mode.
  secretName: ""

probe:
  # Probe log level
  messageLevel: warn

  # The probe processes in the container are run by the netcool user. When set to true, the helm chart will specify the UID and GID values to be 
  # assigned to the netcool user. 
  # Otherwise if false, the netcool user will not be assigned any UID or GID by the helm chart.
  #
  # When the helm chart is deployed in an environment that is enforced by PodSecurityPolicies (PSP) or SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) that 
  # requires the probe process to have a fixed UID and GID value, this parameter must be set to true. Examples of these policies is the 
  # `ibm-restricted-psp` and `ibm-restricted-scc`.
  # Otherwise, if the helm chart is deployed in an environment enforced by an SCC that requires the probe process to support arbitrary UIDs, 
  # this parameter must be set to false. An example of this policy is the OpenShift `restricted` SCC.
  setUIDandGID: true

  # A comma-separated list of acceptable SSL Common Names when connecting to Object Server using SSL.
  # This should be set when the CommonName field of the received certificate does not match 
  # the name specified by the primaryServer property. When a backupServer is specified, 
  # the probe will create an Object Server pair with AGG_V as the name. Set this parameter if the 
  # Common Name of the certificate does not match AGG_V.
