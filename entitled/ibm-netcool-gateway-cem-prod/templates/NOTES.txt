-----------------------------------------
You can run `helm test` command to verify the CEM Gateway status.

helm test --tls {{ .Release.Name }}

If the test passes, it indicates that CEM Gateway is running and should start forwarding
Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) events to Cloud Event Management.

You can then login to Cloud Event Management UI and verify that there are incidents in the Incidents Dashboard 
created by Netcool Operations Insight (NOI) events forwarded by the CEM Gateway.
